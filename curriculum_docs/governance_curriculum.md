### SecKC Submission
- Speaker: Kevin Shekleton
- Recorded: 2018
- Key Takeaways:
  - It wasn't that long ago when hackers and security researchers publicized 0-day vulnerabilities, much to the chagrin of the companies whose software they were testing. After several years, the two communities have largely reached an accepted compromise in the form of coordinated disclosure. Google's Project Zero is a one of the most prominent groups in which their security researchers follow a 90 day coordinated disclosure policy. However, there are some within the security research community that are pushing back against the notion of responsible disclosure, arguing that research is being undervalued by the very companies that directly benefit from their hard work. These researchers argue that the security research community not only needs to command a higher profit for their work, but that they need to demand companies take a stronger stance to improve their security posture. Leading the forefront of this controversial movement is a security research firm that is focused on improving security in a particular field: healthcare. Join me as we examine a retrospective of their security research and the legal and financial repercussions...as well as a broader analysis to see if this is an isolated event or indicative of a much larger trend...

In this talk, you will learn about the differences and similarities between ChatGPT and AutoGPT, how they work, what they can do, and what are some of the challenges and opportunities they present for the future of conversational AI. You will also get to see some live demos of both chatbots, and discover how you can try them out yourself. Whether you are a novice or an expert, this talk will give you a glimpse into the cutting-edge of AI technology and its potential applications.

### SecKC Submission
- Speaker: Patrick Ecord
- Recorded: 2025
- Key Takeaways:
  - Everything is time. Voltage? That’s a time-based slope. Temperature? A time-averaged voltage between metals. Resistance? Only meaningful over time. In this talk, I’ll spiral into a barely-controlled rant about how literally every measurement you care about is just a function of time—backed by a chaotic diagram and conspiracy-board energy. Bonus: I’ll show how to build your own Stratum 1 GPS time server with a Raspberry Pi, so you can reject the NTP deep state and control your own clocks. It’s science. It’s paranoia. It’s time.

You keep scrolling, hoping for clarity. But instead, you stumble into some cryptic post from that one “train guy” with their 17 LoRa nodes and bizarre maps that look like spaghetti. Now you’re even more confused. Where do you even begin? This talk is here to rescue you— An approachable, slightly ridiculous Meshtastic 101 rundown! We’ll cover: - What Meshtastic actually is - How it works - Why it works - How to get started - And most importantly— How YOU can sit back, sip your tea, and enjoy the spicy Meshtastic Facebook drama like a true insider.

### How To Make DevOps Audit-Proof Without Pissing Off Your Auditor
- Watch: https:///www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3GXxmZKC4c
- Key Takeaways:
  - Does your auditor understand the concept of virtualization? How about "DevOps" or containerization? These terms, unfortunately, are foreign to most security standards bodies, including the PCI Council, which means that the individuals charged with auditing companies against these standards lack guidance on how to properly assess this technology and the accompanying concepts. We all know the operational advantages of DevOps, but explaining it to an auditor is not exactly a walk in the park. This talk will detail how DevOps environments can meet standards for separation of duties and change control established in a variety is security standards, including the PCI-DSS, and how you can talk to and educate your auditor in these concepts without coming across as snarky. I might even save you money if you're keeping a physical environment hanging around just to make your auditors comfortable.
