- Key Takeaways:
  - Career development can be expensive, and is absolutely necessary. Some employers look favorably on institutional training from a well-known vendor, or well-known conferences. This talk will discuss using side gigs to maximize your ability as an IT Professional to fund your learning and travel and get the government to let you do it in a tax advantaged way! In today's dynamic professional landscape, continuous development is not just a luxury but a necessity for success. Employers require you to have experience, and training, and don't always want to pay for you to get that. If you’re looking to start a new career, interviewing with a new employer, or just looking to move to a position within your current company, there are ways you can help fund your own career development and have fun doing it. Networking is just as important in our career field as many others. Traveling to conferences, meeting new folks and reconnecting with old acquaintances could lead to the next development for your future. This talk will cover areas such as • What can an LLC do for you? • Legal activities you might be able to write off for development - Including travel related expenses! • Tips to avoid getting into trouble
