literally saves me tons of time during
the assessment especially when it comes
to info gathering
i mean you got a lot of tools that you
want to run on you know a list of
domains or a list
and you can even host it can also help
you like in post exploitation where you
get a shell and you can't get a full
payload or anything like that so
here we go zoexars
i already asked that question
uh how many people use it in their daily
life linux admins hands again all righty
fantastic
all righty so you can do something with
so you have way more functionality i'm
going to cover today i mean you could
have literally a whole day talking about
xrs or you could just use it to automate
something and go do something else with
again so this this all originated
because my initials are in k so they
started calling me north korea
so one day between assessments while
x-arms was turning on some stuff that i
was doing i took it upon myself to draw
a giant fat kim jong-un
white marker was pretty good yeah so
what is xr it's multiplied on
multipliers you can read it from
standard type stuff into it or you can
use the dash a flag and feed it a file
the eye character which is kind of how i
use it uh you can decide to like the
percent symbol and then anywhere in your
command where that percent symbol
appears it'll be substituted with what
was passed in
so the above command you can see it will
run command on whatever's passed in
so for intel gathering uh we make
elusive stuff in this case hostings
and
here is pulling who has records for all
of you know domain names anything else
so uh you can also use it to do
nslookups
uh and you can use what jake just
displayed earlier fierce which is how we
use it most often uh
we defeated a whole list of stuff
so you show the linux box
but sometimes
you don't have interpreter
oh but if you have a shell
you will almost always have xrx in an
editor
and usually that editor is an emacs
what
so once you pop the box
you can paint a list of votes so this is
a poor man's pink suite
wow nice pretty handy
and then it spits you out back for all
the hosts that we're listing uh you can
even use it if you have bash which is
really cool because there's a built-in
function in back where you can do
something like that
so you can call a hostname and a port
right from the dev tree
and create a file that looks like that
wait what is that last edge run that bad
boy only if batch was compiled with
definitely support exactly
sometimes
so
if you have those preconditions which on
a lot of discos you will
um
fight this bad way in there and here you
go
and by the way the reason you want to
use this instead of just piping is
saying stupid too many arguments yes
can you repeat that actually yeah if you
just pipe into a batch it'll give you
too many arguments
yeah there's a max parameter that you
no i think it's 256. okay
so handy yes handy handy saves you tons
of time we use it a lot
i use a lot save me a ton of time so
