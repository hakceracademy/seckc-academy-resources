all right how's everybody doing this
evening having a good time
how many people here have given a talk
they would call like a major
presentation in front of a big room of
people before
that's a lot of fun isn't it a lot of
fun exciting well it can be fun
um not gonna lie public speaking can be
oh what is this
it's clear
what is cold medicine it's a roofie
it's water what the hell is that
put that out here
i said i'm sick i need medicine
so public speaking is really really hard
a lot of people think that it is one of
the most terrifying things you can ever
do
um
but really i if you put enough into it
and you put a little planning into your
individual talk that you're going to
give it can be a lot of fun to put
together and it can be a lot of fun to
give and it can be a help you
really succeed in your career and take
things to the next level
um tonight we're going to walk through
how you can plan a good presentation and
this is a presentation this isn't like
you know the the update on sales for
your internal group that kind of thing
we're going to be talking about giving
big ballroom tile ballroom style
presentations kind of like this
maybe on this scale a larger scale
something along the sides of the defcon
something like that this is something
that's really going to wow the crowd and
make sure that once you give a talk once
you're going to get invited to speak
again
let's talk about some things that go
into a
i'm being interrupted sorry sorry so we
have a tradition here set kc what's that
sick or not
you have to do a shot
i'll do that
here's to you guys because without you
see that's much better much better
okay i got three things on the on the
screen
any good
presentation at any scale talking about
any topic needs to do three things
in this order
you're going to come out here knowing
this
they're go you're going to entertain
people people are going to come out of
your talk saying that they had a good
time you're going to inform them they're
going to they're going to learn
something new
and then third and finally they might
learn some really nitty gritty details
about things or maybe they'll get out
and they'll want to change their
behavior
the goal you have in mind is this when
somebody leaves your talk
at a conference or even at work they're
talking to somebody else and they say
hey what'd you do
yesterday well i saw this really cool
talk by so-and-so
it was a lot of fun to watch i learned
about x y or z
and holy crap am i going to do a b and c
now
right so they had a good time they got
informed about something
and they learned something they can take
down the road
uh all right so what else what else uh
when you're going into this
what do you need to put into this
you need to put in some passion
you need to put in a whole lot of
preparation if you want to do this well
and then when you're giving your talk
you want to have a certain amount of
panache you want to have a little bit of
a stage presence you want to be able to
interact with the crowd and feel
make people feel that you're comfortable
with the mic and you're comfortable with
them it's all about establishing a
connection between you and the people
watching your presentation okay
let's talk about the first part let's
talk about finding your passion
this is the most important of those
three qualities
why well passion is really really hard
to fake
okay you want to see somebody faking
passion
go to a work meeting
hey
hey guys we've got a new unified hr
system and everybody's going to love
using it so you can put in your your pco
right hooray no that's fake you don't
want to do that if you're going to
present something like this you don't
really want to fake your passion about
things
when you've got the right topic a lot of
these other things we're going to talk
about come a lot easier it's a lot
easier to kind of own the room it's a
lot easier to interact with the crowd
and it's a lot of it
now you can't see the front of this but
one great example of somebody that gives
a talk that is extremely passionate and
is passionate about this is
extremely contagious
is sami sami sankar sami kankar
um
you just watch the guy you get excited
you know you may not make tiny little
hardware things but when you get done
watching his talk you want to go do that
too
okay
passion can be tough a lot of people ask
me you know i've done a lot of public
speaking i've talked to big cons like
def con or black hat and a lot of people
ask me hey why haven't you gone and
spoken again
when are you going to do this again
honestly the answer to that is i haven't
found the thing that i'm passionate
about enough that's going to be new and
a unique take to bring to something like
that
um
i'm you know i'm looking for that but
until i get there there are other people
that have topics that they're passionate
about too you know i could probably get
get up and i could do the annual legal
roundup of big you know cyber law cases
damn i should take a shot
um
but that's kind of boring that's not
something i'm passionate about and
therefore i don't want i don't want to
bring that in um kind of a funny story
a few years ago i was on the slate to
give a talk on the annual e-discovery
update
for the
law school for their big marathon cle
program
and for one reason or another i was just
completely jaded about my job and where
things were in e-discovery and i just
wasn't very happy about the topic that i
was trying to talk about
um i tried to force it i tried to sit
there and figure out you know how am i
gonna how am i gonna find this fire in
my belly so this talk doesn't suck for
an hour
and eventually i decided i couldn't do
it
and i did something that at the time i
fully expected to be a huge mistake and
i expected to never speak in public ever
again
i actually scrapped my entire talk and
went up on stage with 10 things written
on a napkin
it was like cloud computing and mobile
forensics things that i thought were
going to be interesting where technology
and the law interact
over the next couple years and i got in
front of an audience of 300 people and i
said i have no slides i have nothing
prepared i have these 10 things let's
have a conversation interrupt me ask
questions as we go and let's have a good
time and see where it goes
i didn't end up completely crashing and
burning in fact i got a lot of great
feedback
what i learned from that is that a good
talk is not at all about necessarily
your slide deck
it's not about your handout it's about
interacting with the crowd and making
that connection and and sharing some
things that you feel strongly with and
and getting people to buy into that does
that make sense
all right let's talk about writing the
talk okay now you've got your topic
how do you how do you get towards
achieving our three goals which are in
entertain interform inform and then
educate right
okay
so you've got a presentation you're
really excited you got your topic what
is the first thing that you do when you
want to start working on a presentation
because if you said open powerpoint you
are dead wrong
no no no no no that is the terrible
terrible terrible idea why is that a
terrible idea powerpoint's not a writing
tool first and foremost
if you're starting there you're starting
at the wrong end as a manager i disagree
well as a manager you're wrong as a
manager you probably want me to use your
corporate slide deck template too and
i'm not going to do that
all right
so
the graph that you see up here which is
difficult to read on this projector kind
of breaks down the my approach to
my time that i spend on a presentation
about 40 percent of this is actually
mapping out my topic
of another 40 percent for actually
writing the content writing the words
that i'm going to say planning for what
i'm going to do
and only 20 percent is spent on slide
design
and really i like to try to keep that
smaller and smaller if i can
because when you're running up to a
deadline it's so easy to sit there and
realize hey i need a cool looking
picture
of steve jobs on stage and needs to be
this resolution and suddenly you're
sitting in there in google image search
hell
for hours and hours looking at the same
pictures and you're digging around with
this instead of working on the words
that are actually going to be coming out
of your mouth
right
all right
this is somebody did say outlining which
is awesome um
pre-writing
i say the word pre-writing and i'm
guessing that 90 of people in here are
flashing back to freshman high school
where an english teacher had you go
through pre-writing exercises where you
need to do this and then you do that and
then you get the note cards when all you
want to do is write the paper so you can
go play playstation
and it seems very silly because
everybody in here is smart nobody in
here really needed to go through all of
those exercises in order to write a five
paragraph essay for your english teacher
but it turns out that she was actually
onto something
this process of mapping out your topics
and breaking things down into categories
and subcategories things like that
it really helps you structure your ideas
and plan out for individual points and
individual slides
there's software that can do this you
can just take out a pencil a piece of
paper and do it
this actually is very very helpful in
chopping up the time slot too
you can look at a time slot that you've
got to fill
and you're worried right especially if
you did the wrong thing it opened up
powerpoint it's like i've got a 45
minute presentation that means i need 90
slides
and if i'm going to get through these 90
slides i better read the titles and then
switch to the next slide as quickly as i
can
no that's that's that's not the right
way to do it
if you want to split things up if you
you think you can probably give two
20-minute talks on a topic and then
stretch a couple of other things out
that's a good thing that's getting you
closer to filling up all the time quote
okay then when you actually start
writing things this is where things get
a little bit more free form whatever
kind of works for you
there's actually a screenshot of what i
had going on this morning
i've got an outliner program open i've
got a text editor where i'd actually
typed out some words actually in prose
as if i were going to read it clearly
i'm not reading from the stage i want to
see somebody read from the teleprompter
state of the union will be on later on
uh
then i've got i do have my slide deck
back in the background there okay
how much you actually write kind of
depends on what your own level of
comfort is
writing everything out will walk your
brain through the words so you may have
an idea what you want to say but just by
typing it out it's going to make it make
it easier for your brain to translate
those into words when you have a mic in
your hand
and once again this is going to help you
structure
your presentation so when you get in
there it's going to feel short it's not
gonna feel like you're up there for
hours and hours and hours why did i hit
that again well there's a little story
a few years ago i was giving a talk on
e-discovery to different agricons and i
got accepted to go speak at schmuckon in
dc which was awesome
and i got done with that and it was
successful and i had a lot of people say
hey why don't you submit this to black
hat
so i get on and i submit black hat and
black hat has a little box it says do
you have any special requests
i said well you know
it's actually kind of hard for me to get
through all the context that i need so i
can explain
common law principles to people
it's hard for me to get through that in
50 minutes so if i can get maybe a
little bit extra time that'd be awesome
what does black hat do they respond by
saying that's great
we have a new track this year and you're
going to be part of it
every talk on this track is three hours
long
congratulations we'll see you in las
vegas
so suddenly i went from having a talk
that was fit pretty tightly into an hour
into having three hours to fill
right
i definitely had to break that up into
different chunks so i had to plan for
breaks just so that people could get
stomach listening to me for three hours
i was sick of myself by the end of that
holy crap
okay so what i like to do is i start
long form okay that that thing that i
showed there to
all that prose
eventually i just scrapped most of that
but that got my brain going with how i
was gonna gonna
work with the talk got my words flowing
i took that outline
and um
then you start filling in chunks pieces
different points that you want to make
and then finally after i really know
what i'm going to be talking about
that's when i'm going to start working
on my slides
let me stop before we get to the slides
i want to make it make a pretty
important point
the handout will absolutely set you free
you might have given a presentation
before either one of these settings or
maybe even work where you've got a lot
of stuff to cover and you're worried
about getting through it
and because your slide deck kind of
sucks
the stuff that comes at the end really
needs some explanation it really needs
you there to explain everything
if you have a full handout typed out not
with the slides an actual paper
then you are free to take questions
waste time because you know that all the
points that you're wanting to get across
are in this paper that you're you're
giving people out you can reference that
you can skip over details you know you
get somebody
raise their hand what kind of antivirus
should i use on my wife's computer
okay
your answer can be like hey i don't need
to answer that right now it's in the
paper
check it out i've got a list right there
we don't need to address it and move on
it's really cool it's really freeing
and especially if you give security
awareness presentations which i'm
getting a lot of us do
you can write one security awareness
paper that outlines the basics and
recycle that thing over and over and
over
your slides might change your demos
might change but the principles the
things that you want your attendees
taking away from this
don't change okay and it got some i
talked he probably read my paper my
paper that i gave out was from 2010 i
haven't changed it but hey you know
people should still use antivirus on
windows boxes it's still current okay
micro
all right
how about before we talk about slides
some questions that should be frequently
asked
those of you that don't know i'm also a
speaker gun at def con which means that
i help shepherd the speakers around
manage the talent if you will so i've
watched
um and um so consequently i've watched a
lot of talks a lot of different
approaches a lot of a lot of bad
mistakes
so let's let's talk about some of these
these questions that should be asked
should i use linux as my host operating
system when i'm plugging into a
projector that i've never seen before
no no no no no
no
if you can't figure out how to use uh
virtualbox to get a linux vm spun up on
a windows machine
probably shouldn't be giving the talk
anyway
okay um should i use open source slide
software something from like libreoffice
or something like this no no no
no
you should use keynote or powerpoint
preferably keynote not powerpoint but
whatever don't use something obscure
what about google docs
i hear that's great for collaboration
yeah
so that way you and your presenting
buddy can collaborate on the day of your
talk at def con and then show up to give
your presentation and say
do you guys have network because all of
our stuff's in the cloud
that answer on a sunday morning just so
you know is going to be no
give it without okay
um
all right what it's 2016. shouldn't i be
able to plan on the projector supporting
1080
and hdmi
no no no absolutely no no you will have
1024 by 768 by way of a vga port and you
will like it
not only that you might be surprised
whenever you show up
and find a place that that has a
projector that only supports 800 by 600
and let me tell you whenever you're
messing with your slides trying to get
things to fit into that the crowd is
going to be a lot more forgiving once an
800 by 600 projector than it will at
1024 by 768 that everybody else during
the day has had no problem
okay don't be cute
get there do your talk and that's it
nobody is impressed by the by the fact
i think that would have been open bsd
that's all right
okay
quickly moving along let's talk about
slide design slide design is possibly
one of the more fun aspects of this
now you've got the point that you've got
your ideas fleshed out you know in a
very clear and concise manner you know
what you're going to be talking about
for how long been thinking through what
you wanted to feel like on stage things
like that
um but here's the problem
your sides all suck
okay
my slides also suck i've given some very
bad presentations um actually if you
want to see one of the most terrible
presentations ever go back and find my
talk
the first time that i spoke at def con i
broke every one of these rules that i'm
telling you to do now
i was putting together the slides on the
airplane i was choosing this font that
was like chicken scratch because i
thought it made me look like edgy yeah
but it turns out the font just wasn't
very readable
not a very smart kind of thing okay
here's where you start
let's say that you get you've been
chosen to go speak at b-sides def con
black hat something like that
second c
someplace especially that if somebody's
going to pay for your travel or anything
like that you want to put your best
effort into this
go buy yourself a copy of the book
called presentation zen by garr reynolds
and read it cover to cover it's going to
sound very familiar because i cover a
lot of this stuff but i bought that
before i went out to black hat because i
knew that oh these people are paying me
i better step my game up here okay
buy it go through it read it love it
uh get some taste
okay look at some design stuff
um
you know don't look at your android
phone for for design cues for for your
uh
for your slides you want things that are
minimal easy to read things are going to
be easy to read back in the back of the
room we could spend hours and hours
talking about nothing but slide but
slide design okay
let's break down some common problems
here
right so slides like this are bad for
the presenter
they're bad for the presentation and
they're bad from the audience okay they
distract the audience from the center of
attention which is you the speaker
okay
and it distracts from the points that
you're really trying to get across and
you're thinking to yourself well these
are important points that's why they've
got a bullet next to them that's why
they're on the screen
but here's the problem when you've got
stuff like that
it's it's too easy for you the presenter
to fall into that cardinal sin of
reading off the slides okay
if you want to add emphasis to a point
okay
don't put it as a point on your slides
what just happened there do you all
notice that as soon as i switched this
slide
to a picture that didn't have any text
all of your eyes shifted from the wall
of text that was there back to me and
you're seeing me make my point again
make sense
anything that takes the audience away
from you is bad
right it's one of those things that we
learn in trial advocacy it's another
kind of fun thing if you guys are
watching any of these courtrooms like
real life true prime things and like how
to make a murderer
if you watch the attorneys on there and
what they're doing whenever you see
somebody giving a direct examination and
they're asking open-ended questions of
their own clients they're always going
to be out of the way so the client is
talking to the audience over there
but if there's cross-examination going
on meaning i'm hostile to the other guy
i'm standing in between the witness and
the box and i'm the center of attention
okay
kind of a cool thing to watch it's a
very simple technique that illustrates
my point
when people are there to listen to you
and you're making the points don't
distract them from the center of
attention okay
all right i'm sorry i know that i'm
picking on people here i love you all
very much
i really do
but boy
putting text on a gif is the new clip
art
i don't it's kind of you know can be
kind of funny but you can do better than
this you can do better than this it's
not that much better than the big wall
of text
you can even take this you can even find
a bigger picture of grumpy cat take it
the entire size you're still getting
your joke out of the way you're still
getting your uh your meme quota
but but it looks better it looks more
professional okay
all right here's another one
oh man code on a screen
but but but my python's great i want
people to see it and love it and be
impressed python that i can write
no
no nobody up nobody in the back can see
it i can't see it and even if they could
they're sitting there trying to parse it
and they're either thinking i have no
idea what this guy is thinking or
the other thing is you got to realize
that for a large portion of the people
in the audience if you're showing code
on the screen i don't care what it is i
don't care if it's scratch
most of the people in the audience
aren't going to know
what that code is or what it does it all
looks like regular expressions to most
of the room
okay
okay so now that you know you get that
out and and and if you have any
questions about this as you're going
through and you're thinking boy i ought
to add a code snippet
think to yourself of those three
elements here what is that code snippet
gonna add is it gonna be
entertaining for people is it going to
inform them of your new syntax
highlighting or is it going to educate
them maybe educate but you're not you're
not giving a talk in a python class okay
oh buddy
so now it's time that we talk about live
demos
um this is one that i've broken uh that
broken this rule as a general rule
live demos are a bad idea
live demos are a very bad idea because
live demos almost always break
and when they break they train wreck and
we when you are sitting there with just
silence in the room
while people wait for the lamp to turn
on
okay
because that's all your demo is you're
up there with four computers three of
them running linux you tried to plug
them all into the laptops all so you can
make one lamp turn on
and it doesn't turn on people will get
up and leave the room
who was in that wayne were you in that
talk
two years ago there was a guy
yeah i think you both were in there
there was a guy at defcon that gave an
internet of things talk
that crashed so bad the room was half
full at the beginning and by the end i
swear there were 20 people there because
he sat up sat down
read his slides and i gave a demo that
crashed it was bad it was embarrassing i
felt bad for the guy he did not get a
speaker patch
but boy
it's pretty rough
now
i take that and and to
the the other
um side of that coin the very same year
on the same stage
excuse me we had this group called red
balloon get up okay these guys from um
uh cornell or something like this and
they gave this incredible talk where
they broke into a corporate network and
they rolled in there you know you know
i'm running the stage and these guys
roll in with just casey pelican case
after pelican case bringing in this gear
setting up a printer setting up a switch
it was nuts and i was like are you guys
really going to do a live demo they're
like it's all live like are you sure
this is going to be a disaster like no
we've done it a zillion times and sure
enough they had
and they were able to get everything
done
i've never seen anything be done like
that they must have practiced it 10 000
times taking it down putting it back
together you're probably not going to
have that much time certainly if it's
your first time you don't have a big
crew with you to make that happen
it's pretty it's pretty tough
okay
um
what can you do instead okay because we
all like to see somebody pop a box you
know
you might have seen that uh dave
kennedy's talk a few years ago where he
uh was showing off fast track he pops
like 20 boxes in the course of an hour
it's great
but that's so hard to pull off in person
how can you do that effectively without
risk
make a screencast of it hell in cali
linux screencasting is built in right
take a screen recording of it put some
music over it you can narrate what's
going on whatever you're giving the talk
it's stable it's always going to be
there highly highly recommend that
on the other side of the token though
putting those together is really hard
because you're going to want to get it
exactly right whenever you do it so
sometimes you might have to kind of
break loose and you might actually do it
live
i actually did this um from my talk that
i gave to the lawyers this year
i um was i used metasploit an
interpreter and i actually broke into a
windows machine
from cali linux live on this laptop
and i gave that talk probably eight
different times
live demo worked fine every single time
why did it work and why was i confident
enough to do that
um
well first of all i knew it was
repeatable i tried it i tried to see if
it would bug out and not work i felt
pretty confident about that there's the
other thing i used only vms
and those two vms my victim vm and my
attacking vm i didn't do anything to
those other than use them for my talk
okay no patching i didn't even open
documents because it was in a known
state but i could all i knew that it was
going to work every single time
the goal there is to work to work it so
that you can get up and give the demo
just by hitting the up button
in your bash history you know you want
to have it right there to be like yep
nope i can do this right here without
even knowing any of the commands because
i use this vm so little
when you do that the demo works pretty
well i thought it was pretty fun um but
always plan on things going completely
pear-shaped so even if you are going to
do a live demo maybe have a screencast
sitting there as a backup
um anybody has any questions or anything
like that as we keep going through i'm
doing pretty good on time
but feel free to feel free to ask
questions
okay so now you got some slides now you
got an outline
now it's time to put everything together
and then edit the living hell out of it
so that it accomplishes our goals what
are our goals
entertain inform and educate in that
order okay
talks are fun talks are fun we're gonna
make this make this fun
practically how do you make this happen
you got your outline you got a slide
deck over here you got things kind of
mixed around what i like to do is take
that outline and take the individual
parts and pieces of that and copy them
into individual slides
right so i've got cues about what i want
to do what i want to talk about
i've got to match that with my slides
so i know that i've covered all the
material in my outline i know i've got
everything accounted for and then i've
also got everything all in one spot
okay
um
if if everything's going well
you can get to your presenter notes uh
through keynote in my instance right
here it's actually what i'm doing right
now
but of course you're going to prepare
for everything to go badly
so you can also print out your little
handout your traditional handouts with
your slides with your notes right next
to them
when i spoke at black hat i was nervous
enough that i just planned on everything
not working i showed up with a binder
and all my materials for three hours
worth of talking in a you know in hard
copy
so another projectors worked
and
500 people showed up it was cool i was
ready to go
make sense backups backups backups
all right so we're putting this all
together now now we've talked a little
bit about the you know passion in
choosing your choosing your topic we've
talked about the preparation but how do
you turn that into some innocent
how do we make that how do we make this
exciting folks
um what you see on stage right on the
slide right here how many people have
heard of ted talks before this point's
not terribly obscure they're everywhere
one of the things that happens whenever
you're selected as a ted speaker i'm
talking about real ted not tedx real ted
they send you a block of stone with 10
presentation commandments
which sounds awesome i want one of these
so bad these are all very good i didn't
transcribe these you guys can google
them yourselves you should the next time
but i think they're all very good of
course one of them is don't read your
slides
you know
some of some of these things are pretty
basic
a couple other resources for putting
this all together like i said
presentation zen and then there's
another book on slide design called
slideology that's pretty good but really
what you want to do is you want to
you're trying to develop your style
or you're trying to see
examples of people doing this right
there are now there are lots more
examples of people doing these type of
ballrooms ballroom presentations right
i would be remiss if i didn't talk about
steve jobs whether you like the man or
not uh the man kind of brought the idea
of don't suck at presenting back into
corporate lexicon
um
because great presentations one of the
things i that i really like to watch his
presentations for are his pacing
and the fact that he is always extremely
cool you even you see when when a demo
starts to go haywire
he's very cool under the collar even
though he's going to turn around and
fire 10 people as soon as the
presentation is done even if it went
fine
that's you know you want to be as cool
as that this demo is about going haywire
what's this
oh you know who i am oh man
i'm not i'm not even going to sleep
tonight now all right
cheers
yeah
okay about stephen colbert yeah
one of the things that i like that
stephen colbert does
uh certainly back when he was doing his
old show not the new weird show with
band
when he used to do the thing with called
the word right he would talk and then
words would show up and then people
would laugh
i showed you how you ought to interact
with your slides
he reads his copy off the teleprompter
like like there's nothing going on
beside him and then people laugh the
slides are there to emphasize
and and and
occasionally draw attention
um but
you don't want to be interacting with
your slots be more like yeah
when we were talking about educating and
informing
who is the absolute best explainer type
speaker in the entire world
no question bill clinton hell yeah um
you're we're all going to see are way
too much of bill clinton here in the
next few months when you do pay
attention to how smooth he is and how he
can take a very complex subject and some
people ask me how do i take a complex
object and break it down
try to look even though it's not going
to be directly the same way look at the
way that bill will take something and
just break it down into simple
components so that you can be on board
with things that are affecting the
international economy i think he does a
great job of that he plays a saxophone
and he plays saxophone which we won't
hold against him
oh if you want a boo you just wait for
the next slide
there has been somebody else that has
emerged on the public stage as somebody
that i think you ought to watch and pay
attention to for some very minor points
say what you will about what the man
says when he gets in front of a stage he
needs no teleprompter he needed no
preparation
but he has enough panache to stand there
and absolutely own the stage and own the
crowd and when things go haywire in the
audience as they typically do kind of
like they are here
the man is never
he he never falters when he's up there
okay
so
you know the press is going to make you
make you watch them anyway watch them at
least for uh for those reasons okay
what about some more hacker people now
now i don't want to i didn't pick
anybody out here and there are lots and
lots and lots of other speakers i was
coming over driving over from my house
thinking about all the other people i've
left out
a couple examples of great speakers in
the security world that you might want
to check out for one reason or another
street who has spoken here before
yeah illustrates one of the most
important parts of speaking
tell stories and tell a good story okay
jason tells great stories about him out
there and pen testing and breaking into
stuff
um
you may come away with nothing else from
here but you might
come away here you know remembering some
funny stories i told about the
shenanigans i was involved in whenever i
was trying to give talks which i'll
bring up here soon okay tell a story
stories are engaging stories are
entertaining and entertaining stories
fitting with our first of the three
goals right okay
about these two jokers uh
this is uh this is charlie and chris
um who give lots of talks on car hacking
okay
if you ever watch one of the talks you
should
it's entertaining i could show one of
those talks to my parents
and they would come out being
entertained they would know something
more and they probably would turn in
their car and go buy an old mid 90s you
know
gmc truck or something like that right
these guys are great a lot of the stuff
that they pull off is really difficult
to do especially in a pair but remember
your goal always is to first entertain
really you can you can
just take things and watch a bunch of
ted talks you can find people that are
giving great presentations that are very
engaging they're not terribly long
you also understand that hey you don't
need an hour to make a pretty salient
point if you want to okay
all right so now you got your slide deck
together you got your your your uh uh
your hand out everybody's got that okay
now we're planning for the big day
right uh
plan on everything going completely
upside down projector is not going to
work uh the mic is not going to work
the podium is actually in the other
corner um this was actually a problem
for my talk at blackhead this is a room
that held probably 2 000 people and it
was wide it wasn't very deep it was very
wide and they had a stage in that corner
and a stage in that corner and the mod
and the screens were on both sides and
they wanted me to stand in the middle
not near my not near the laptop anything
like that but you had to yeah i had to
roll with it so plan on everything being
completely wrong
be ready to give your talk with no
slides whatsoever if you've been doing
your slides the old way and reading from
your slides that's probably terrifying
if you do this the right way you'll be
ready to rock no matter what
get your adapters together the night
before give yourself plenty of time to
go to the apple store if you have to get
the right adapter never count on a
conference or anybody else having the
adapter that you need i have been in
that situation
for my first talk at defcon i had to get
an adapter from the crowd that was a
hoot
and charge all your things right now
i hope the battery doesn't go dead in my
laptop because there's no power up here
had to plan for that in advance and plan
that for an advance um put your notes
on all your things have a copy on your
phone have a copy on your laptop have a
copy on your tablet i uploaded all my
stuff into slack today so that if i
needed to i could just hop onto somebody
else's machine and download the things
out of slack and i'd be ready to go okay
um
okay work with the organizers if you if
you do one of these professional talks
they're going to get a hold of you in
advance they're going to give you some
little form that you're going to want to
ignore it's going to say please fill out
all of your ap needs and please send us
a copy of your deck
you're not going to send them a copy of
your deck you're going to send them a
copy of your handout
but you're going to want to work with
those people they're very nice but they
really don't have a lot of say in the
way things that go okay
um if you've ever been to a big big um
uh big conference or a big hotel and you
see the av staff who aren't wandering
around
those guys are walking atms for the for
the for the hotel okay because anytime
you ask a guy that's wearing an av shirt
to do something they're going to charge
somebody for it
so don't walk into a room in the middle
of a conference and say hey this isn't
any good and find the closest guy in a
hotel shirt and say hey you need to move
that drop over there that over there and
then the podium moved over here
a they probably will say no and if they
don't that's because they're going to
charge the conference organizers a huge
amount of amount to do that so when you
get in there roll with it
roll with it
they will offer you a laptop they do
this all the time we'll have a laptop
set in advance so just send us your deck
and we'll have your deck loaded up on
the thumb drive do you trust that
no
no it's probably an old laptop
different operating system that you're
used to
if you were to give them a powerpoint
presentation or a keynote presentation
you're rolling the dice that all the
fonts that you have inside of your
presentation will be installed on that
machine
you don't you're going to show up all
your fonts are wonky and nobody can read
anything on the screen
okay
how do you work around that always bring
your own machine always be ready to help
yourself
i also like to you probably saw that on
the desktop before i actually export all
of my slides to pdf
because i've got a pdf of this i can
just open up a preview on a mac take it
full screen and i'm giving the exact
same presentation i would be in keynote
right
um that's also why you didn't see any
builds any effects anything like that
it's distracting and it's just stuff it
can break
okay
oh yeah let's talk about booze
okay so this applies especially in the
hacker world and of course i am breaking
my own rule
because i did just take two shots on
stage
but
i know that that a lot of talks people
get up and they're kind of drunk or they
encourage drinking from the audience or
they are drinking themselves up there
one of the most mind-blowing things i
ever saw first time i went to defcon i
saw dan kaminski get up in a tent
in the middle of the night in the desert
it was hot
and the guys at 13 that's right bill was
there and the guy's got beers just laid
out and he starts in the way that he
warms up the crowd and says hey
every time i make a mistake in my
presentation i've got to chug a beer
and the crowd goes wild it was a lot of
fun and everything like that here's the
thing by the end of his talk he was a
sloppy disaster
and that's fine for dan because dan
could get a job for people that know
that he's a sloppy disaster or was at
one time and it's okay
you don't have that luxury you are not
dan kaminski okay remember that remember
that uh this also goes for
um the night before okay i kind of have
a policy in my own that says i don't
travel
if it's more than an hour away i do not
travel on the day of a talk
period
i always want to get there i want to be
comfortable i want to be relaxed i don't
have time to work on my slides and if i
got to drive down to the lake to give a
talk at noon i got to leave the house at
five o'clock that's no good so i go down
the night before
that is not licensed to go out and stay
up until three taking shots with people
you haven't seen since law school to get
up and give an eight o'clock talk
theoretically i don't know anybody
that's done that before
um
in theory the way that can go is you get
up and maybe you've got enough um
adrenaline going
that you can power through your own talk
but when somebody informs you oh wait
you actually have to sit on the next
panel so you need to sit down now for
the next hour while these judges talk
about stuff
that's really bad because you might
i didn't throw up on stage but it was
really really rough so
keep your wits about you don't do
anything stupid either before or during
your talk if you want to go get hammered
do it after your talk everything's all
done everything's cool if you're talking
about well people will be buying you
drinks anyway
okay
that's enough about the boobs
so now it's go time okay now it's time
to bring party track
what's party track party track was our
departed
fake name for the track that i ran at
defcon but how many people baseball fans
here everybody remember jose lima
yeah this is back when the royals sucks
i'm sorry i know it was almost like four
years ago
not many people watched baseball jose
lima had a thing called lima time and he
said hey when i'm playing it's always
lima time because lima time is about
feeling good and partying okay
party track is all about having a good
time and people learning things okay and
you want to bring that spirit of party
tracking up here having a good time to
every talk that you give
okay so when you get up there you know
like i said be relaxed don't travel on
the day of the talk check in with the
organizers
figure out what punches you're going to
have to roll with there
when you get into that room okay
when somebody says we have we have a
various options of um microphones for
you do you want a lavalier do you want a
handheld mic you want to use this thing
on a podium
my preference
handheld mic
second lavalier third that thing behind
the podium what's the lavalier the
lavalier the lavalier is the wireless
mic okay you gotta pin this little mic
like a little boom onto your shirt it
doesn't work worth a darn if you're
wearing a t-shirt you'll look really
goofy when you're doing it i've not been
to a conference that's fancy enough to
give me the thing with the tape to your
face
so i can't give you any opinion on that
but i much prefer this gives you
something to do with your hands
if you're new to public speaking you
don't know what to do with your hands
and if you don't know what to do with
your hands you look like ben carson
okay ben carson the guy that's still
running for president watch that guy the
next time you see him on tv he has no
idea what to do with his hands he was
like
all the time it's so weird
it's so weird when you get up there
trying to warm up the crowd encourage
questions and answers
if this is a topic that you're
passionate about and you're you consider
yourself an expert in you should be able
to say
q a is a good thing
within reason so
in philly and pump con in philly is a
very small conference uh smaller than
this meeting and it takes place at the
um best western in philly you can't
really shut down the best western so
you'll have randoms walking in
so you've got a bunch of hackers and
you've got a bunch of random people
coming in from west philly which those
are weird people okay
and i'm sitting there i'm giving a
presentation on e-discovery and somebody
raised their hands with a question i'm
like oh thank god i was running out of
slides what's your question sir
what's the uh
what's the guy from a beautiful mind
nash yeah
what's his first name
yeah yeah
so the guy asked me
straight face so how does all this stuff
with the discovery fit in with the
i'm sitting there trying to think am i
missing something
what in the hell and meanwhile like half
the audience you know all the actual
hackers are just laughing their ass like
this is some random dude that is clearly
off of his meds coming in here they have
no idea so you never know what the
audience is going to bring up the other
thing is that you never know when
there's a camera in there and this is
especially a problem with something like
defcon because you never know what
people are going to ask and this is all
on the record well phil zimmerman and
some of these other guys are totally
okay with doing a full hour or a q a
with with no predictability of what's
going to be asked and they've got to
answer everything
good luck to them i prefer q a
afterwards okay
once you get in there deal with the
audience like i said when you're done do
q a always have a bunch of cards to hand
out people might want to reach out to
you later on have a stack i don't have a
stack with me tonight sorry you know
where to find me it's on slack probably
and that's about it
so um let's uh let's go ahead and wrap
things up and cover once again
what are our three goals of any
presentation
in this order
entertain inform and then educate it's
not on there anymore is it no how about
that awesome you guys have been very
great and very attentive i appreciate it
if you guys have any questions i will uh
be back in the back to hear dave's talk
keep that going everybody keep that
going
