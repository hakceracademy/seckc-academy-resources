hello so we're here talking about
chromebooks we all dread them but
they're here to take over
so without further ado next slide
so brief little history of chromebooks
so the chromium project started in 2008
i see i suck at mike's don't worry
uh so kroger projects begin in 2008
first hardware in 2011 at google i o
of all places imagine that google
um and they became very popular in
schools
and they're just starting to get
everywhere they've actually overcome mac
os
in the most popular consumers in 2020
uh for better for worse statistics there
source idc sun you know data harvesting
firm
the hardware so what used to be cheap
hardware
just crap absolute crap plastic
um hinge is terrible very very terrible
i've had early chromebooks became
the same the hardware is still kind of
meh however it's
a bit better now and there's now
more premium stuff way more premium
stuff
for example like my pixelbook go that i
have for testing
so our next would be uh
the features of chrome os which would be
the next slide
uh or yeah so
quite literally used to be a browser
window with some status
now indicators has android apps
unoptimized android apps i should say
because no one puts an effort into doing
teleporting let alone
chrome os porting uh
so yeah just that's just marketing linux
apps however are actually kind of decent
you can pass through usb devices via the
built-in settings app
and gpu acceleration for you gamers that
for whatever reason getting chromebooks
so chrome os is actually based on gen2
linux
believe it or not it's
very devolved from gen 2 i will say
it still has portage though but
it also uses core boot as the firmware
along with a specialized payload that
google develops called
uh depth charge um
core boom payloads are so cool it's an
open source firmware and it uses
payloads to boot into other things
so yeah it's just booting
however it does some fun stuff as i'm
so
um one more slide over
so it uses verified boot essentially
calculates
with uh it calculates a hash shattu hash
of the rewrite firmware
and then takes uh
takes a signature of that an rsa
signature and verifies that with a
private key and read only firmware
um just
for verified boot uh the read write
firmware then compute hashes
of all the non-volatile parts of the
it hold on
um
and an additional protections include
you know block level verification via dm
verity
um which dm verity instead of them doing
ahead of time root fs verification
because that will cost like five seconds
off the boot time and google's like
we need fast boot time instead we're
going by a block by block basis on
demand
which actually does not seem that
inefficient
um usually each time you read from the
block it only has like a 0.2 millisecond
uh
overhead and then
it also has you know everything in a
stateful partition that's
not that's actually you like user data
and that's encrypted via the tpms uh uh
well not encrypted utv but
uses a tpm to store the encryption keys
like similar to bitlocker
um and then
just redundancy as well as making
updates
smooth
and then everyone probably is like wait
this description of the talk said it was
open where's the open it sounds
very locked down however next slide
um introducing developer mode developer
mode
is a very very powerful thing it's also
easy to get into
press a few key combos and follow some
prompts and bam
you now have a basic access
um that may sound like it defeats the
whole point
of all the security features whenever
someone could just take ownership of
but next slide
that's why every boot you will see the
screen
and the average user is like boom
it only tells me to press space so when
you press space
it actually reverts all that
a user that actually knows what they're
doing and is actually wanting to use
developer mode
they know the hidden key combo ctrl d
to boot the thing and there's also other
uh key combos because as i get into the
next slide
um developer mode lets you actually do a
lot of things
control u lets you boot off of a custom
chrome os
media which er
chromium less rather since you're not
officially supposed to you know
run google's proprietary operating
and you can run
linux or windows via the control
l shortcut because it depending on your
chromebook you're either getting lexi
bios booting
or you're phi booting
which means you can move the whole thing
if you wanted to
and just you know you're playing all
but we could take this a step further
next slide
and you could just flash completely
different operating system
operating system firmware um
since like i said earlier chromebooks
are using
core boot which is a completely open
source firmware and google
when they made chromebooks want the user
to be able to also own their device
they have the same philosophy with
android phones um
you can write the firmware after
disabling write protect
on some old write protect screw on older
models by unscrewing the screw and
sometimes you have to peel off that film
because that's still there everyone
likes film
but on newer models they use a custom
chip called a cr50
that definitely is a chromium element
pun
[Music]
in order to disable write protect on
that you unplug the battery you boot the
systems out the battery plugged in
and voila um you could also
if you want to you can use closed
chassis debugging however
i'm not going to talk about that much
because i just simply have no experience
with that
and documentation is a little bit of a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if you ask me
um but what you can also do
is that since you're using you can flash
your own firmware
you can re this opens up to read only
firmware that i was talking about
earlier
to let you flash your own private key or
not
private key that'd be bad public key
and completely reownership your device
custom build acromion with your own
signing keys and it'll be just like
stock no one will ever notice and it's
not google
because [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] google
and on the next slide as i described on
it
there's a few draws drawbacks of this
yes
there could be some it's not you know
completely foolproof
generally reboot will fix it however if
you have
and they have some quality time to your
hardware
physical access mind you yeah they can
probably bypass most protections and all
i see is
oh look my device randomly was reset
sometimes chrome os does that you know
legit oh in this case
yeah you just got absolutely pwned by a
malicious firmware
and a malicious operating system but if
you're like that if someone's actually
that persistent
towards you you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anyways bye
bother
um yeah
and yeah i guess that's actually about
it i gave myself plenty of time for
questions
so
actually first about me um i'm just a
college student at uh ku doing computer
engineering discord tag
is up there i'm not going to bother
pronouncing it since
mike is not good quality enough for me
to be able to actually get that
so but i'm also
definitely right now my job is in a
kind of a sticky situation um so
if anyone has any job opportunities
please
get in touch with me i'm scared i need a
job
code was not fun on my grades and i
[Music]
anymore
you totally won't regret it i already
got my
but uh i also am part of the
k information security club so if any of
you guys are casual or don't think you
are
because you all look a bit older than
that uh
i used to and i use it occasionally
however
over at the audio station i have a nice
m1 macbook
you might be asking why am i talking
about chrome os
well [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] google just simply [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] google
the reason why this talk exists was
because we had just had a nice fun
conversation set kc discord
and we were just like you know what'd be
cool this talk
it is just merely convenience
