okay it's 6 15 and i'm a stickler for
time
so here we go um all right
let's see if first time i've done this
okay let's see if my timing's worked out
so
uh if you've never been here before
maybe this is your first one
maybe you've been too drunk at every
meeting you've been to uh this is the
news
so excuse me i do this in ignite format
uh it's a drinking game now too oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
all right i'm already going slow so
where do you get the links uh that's
gonna be on our slack we've got this
newslinks channel you should go in there
uh check it out let's see two drunk by
615 lol that's right i can still read
comments too
twitch get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of here i got
zoom
uh here's the new feature i told you
about shot time let's test it out real
quick
okay yeah it works okay cool so
first and foremost um if you didn't know
what's happening uh you should have
you should check out the def con safe
mode content it's all up on the media
server now
it's pretty sweet you can go get it uh
it's and it's all there you didn't even
have to bring hard drives this year so
that's pretty tight
thunder spy is the thing uh oh my god
where are my notes it's covered by the
chat
uh this is uh something affecting all
thunderbolt equipped systems
sucks to be those that's a lot of things
now uh you should they got a thing you
can run to see if
you're vulnerable to it you should maybe
think about running that i don't know
um yeah yeah definitely take a look at
that why is this 15 seconds staying so
much longer than
the last 15 seconds no what's happening
are my are my timings booked
oh oh god i'm gonna have to manually do
this
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay here we go moby friends uh
let's see 3.7 million users of moby
friends
some barcelona-based dating app uh it
was originally
one over let's see what it contains uh
email address uh uh
relating to a book big uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh hey
they're they're working okay
uh rdp attacks are on the rise so
probably not surprising given the
pandemic and everything
work from home is completely shifting
what defenders have to deal with and
what we've known how to deal with for
some time
if you don't have edr on your systems by
now uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
uh so let's see facebook did a thing
where uh they changed the sdk and on ios
it made a bunch of applications go bro
and by burr i mean oh man it's pinned
why am i
i should be showing up here not you ben
webb there we go
come on show me no where did you go uh
whatever
samsung zero click ball oh yeah like
there was a thing that affected a bunch
of samsung phones
uh like all of them made since 2014 or
some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] god dammit [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
uh and uh yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] patch that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
uh this guy got this two thousand dollar
bike uh
and uh and it got brick because they got
bought or sued or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and he didn't want that to go away so he
just decided to fix it with a raspberry
pi you can learn about that if you want
to click on that link when you see it
uh you know i'm gonna come out and say
it not all leaks are bad all right
uh there was this cat that uh uh what
they're calling it project whispers
uh 10 million internal images from over
100 discord servers run by neo-nazis and
uh qan on people and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that
uh we had another leak here that's a
little figaro it's a french daily
newspaper 7.4 billion records containing
uh personally identifying information of
42
000 users including your plain text and
or hash password
md5 that won't take long or anything i
read some shitty news about firefox
today but before i read that i read
about this
which is firefox relay that's coming out
on a beta near you
maybe who knows they killed off their
whole like uh threat intelligence team
today if
you hadn't heard so ah that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
sucks uh
some cat did a really cool investigation
on pyc
files so figuring out what's in those
their python cache files
as it turns out sometimes really
sensitive stuff gets stuck in there so
uh basically you know take a look at
your pyrc file add them to your git
ignore [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that
uh we got a leak here from ais cellular
this is thailand's largest cell network
they pulled this database offline that
had
millions oh excuse me billions of
real-time internet records on millions
of thai users uh basically you could see
what someone was doing in real time
creepy ass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
contact tracing obviously a very popular
topic right now but uh very
delicate topic as well so qatar had a
mandated like install
thing and it turned out they done [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
up and you could see someone's gps
coordinates and health status so
mathway had a breach uh but they didn't
even know about it until they saw
25 million of their records being for
sale on the dark web that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucks
uh they're a really popular like
education app on uh android and ios
so that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happens i guess uh this
researcher got a hundred thousand
dollars from apple for figuring out
something about jwts i don't know
i read this really light i wasn't really
sure what happened it gets really
confusing to me so maybe if you're
smarter than me
you can look at this and know what's up
uh and more funny news uh some hackers
decided that the chicago police could go
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off and they decided to uh
air over their radios tay zonday's
chocolate rain
and of the classic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the police by
nwa
so ah that's fun west tech is a company
that got breached you probably haven't
heard of them because defense
contractors don't usually like to be
heard about
but they have a lot of clients like the
air force the navy
the army the joint service agencies um
but it's it's cool
nothing happened probably right uh
sophos had a state of ransomware report
that they dropped again this is just
like a
view of things but sophos is a global
company so yeah go for it right they
probably got a decent idea
they they had a thing uh maybe maybe
take a look at it it's a good data point
uh apparently the rhodium's got a lot of
zero days right now as for ios they're
just like hey quit
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sending us to it we're not
paying you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh used to be like five
hundred thousand dollars for a zero day
that went down to like two hundred
thousand for
uh over the past like three months or so
oh hey shot time all right if you're
[Music]
these boots are from our defcon party if
you're cool you would have one
all right uh cloudeye is this company
that uh that
got exposed as a malware front so they
were basically saying like hey we'll
hide your binaries from being able to be
reverse engineered
uh which is a legitimate service and
everything but it turns out these guys
are like soldered to malware people too
i knew i would have to do this someday
uh yep we did a thing
um you can read about it if you want to
uh
some social security numbers may have
been compromised
oops uh the uh south africa bank post
bank
uh they they got a problem where they
suspect some employees took the master
key
uh and have actually made off with like
3.2 million dollars worth of stuff on
that so
that's got to be a fun thing to put in
your dr plan lamp phone is something
amazing from those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at ben
gurion university uh they
have figured out how to record a
conversation by looking at the lamp
uh which sucks to be them because my
broke ass only has
one light up in that lamp that's why the
lighting's so bad in here
uh ripple 20 is a thing that happens so
uh
trek tcp ip stack that's that's a thing
uh and it's used in a lot of things so
dependencies everywhere i actually think
i have that in a slide later
uh it probably affects you uh this
company galcom they
ended up having a series of plugins that
uh collectively have been downloaded 33
million times
uh this company that awake toll uh
figured out that they've been slurping
personal data uh so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
uh golden spy this is some tax software
that was told to be installed on some
western companies devices to uh be you
know
cool with china and turns out it was
spying on you ah who knew
uh wow that never happens right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
um here's a interesting academic paper
on as this title
shows identifying the unintended arms
of cyber security countermeasures that's
kind of thoughtful right like you got to
think about well [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
could some of these things we're doing
be doing maybe a little wrong what's
going on here uh microsoft uh the cyber
security field cto had a really cool
post on her thoughts on social
engineering
um talked about reciprocity scarcity
authority consistency
liking things consensus pretty
interesting post actually
uh encore chat this is this thing that
maybe your drug dealers were using to
buy and sell drugs and the po-po
totally gone all up in that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh your
drug dealers probably well unless they
live out in
uh europe land and stuff but um
oh and on that point i guess if you want
to see if your drug dealers are
screwing you over uh here's a data point
this one company made a dark web price
index i actually just did that all for a
joke they didn't even include drugs in
this so
can't even check my prices what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
man
um let's see so we got analysis of a
home security camera so this is a
chinese home security camera service
which i thought was kind of interesting
that they totally like didn't talk about
uh the title or anything of this but
kind of some interesting things that
they touch on
on uh what sort of privacies you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
uh there's this person i don't subscribe
to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
uh i browse our all with an anonymous i
don't even log in
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] reddit um uh this is a really cool
post to
uh on how to clone a credit card only
takes a minute to do
take a look at it uh the eff have this
really cool new tool that they can show
us how to
uh uh how the police are spying on us
in our own little areas so even that guy
up in iowa you can see the different
ways the popo are spying on him than me
down in columbia
uh apt-29 has apparently been targeting
kobit 19 vaccine development data
this is kind of one of those things
where i'm like hmm can you buy them
though
like this is kind of a global offer why
why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we even holding all
that together
right like like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them but [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you
too
um so there's uh interesting posts by
epsecure talking about a case of some
counterfeit cisco switches uh here we've
got like a comparison between two of
them
um i guess b be careful about that sweet
deal you find on set kc
my secret is these boots if you knew use
the bottle [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you
uh let's oh ios 14 is doing a cool thing
where uh you get to
opt in to the advertising identifier
it's the eight idfa you vodka hands
uh who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gonna opt into that
nobody [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] targeted ads they're going
away
maybe probably not they'll be around uh
f5 had a really big vulnerability with
the tmui
interface uh apparently a lot of people
just don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about it
and just don't want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] patch it
um so i i don't know why but you can
look that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up on showdown they're
all there
f1 uh so did nicole be i can't even
pronounce that sober uh has uh
held an argentinian isp ransom for 7.5
million dollars
interestingly enough this hasn't
actually affected any of their customers
so they know
how to i guess get them to pay it's all
internal [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh diebold is uh talking
to
the people that have their their atms
and like hey we've seen some black boxes
that
apparently have some of our own software
in them and we don't really know how
that got in there but we're gonna find
out and
not gonna tell you that uh let's see
this dude uh meow that's
uh for the lulls i guess thing like it's
just smashing they just
delete [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know there's no
explanation there's no i'm gonna hold
this right ransom
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you it's gone i kind of like that
method honestly like you don't deserve
nice things
um a thing happened on twitter uh you
can take a look at that this is some of
the more sinister stuff that happened
with the thing beyond the you know like
the bitcoin tweeting and all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
everyone had fun looking at that
um uh yeah that was the thing they also
caught the dude
uh at least who they think it is but uh
in
typical government fashion they didn't
protect the zoom meeting
uh and and it got zoom bombed with porn
stuff
uh i'm removing people as quickly as i
can when a disruption happens snatch
that after one zoom bomber interrupted a
lawyer
i just i like to think of how that must
have played out that must have been fun
oh no
it's not going again i have to jump it
okay and uh
another so actually i actually hated
this article i read it later and i
realized i was like you don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
even give any evidence to that
but hey just just an announcement
bitcoin's not anonymous if you didn't
know that bitcoin's not anonymous there
are some that kind of are z-cash
uh dji dji has been kind of being a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh again like
overall a lot of people get upset about
it anyway dj has been kind of being a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and some over permissive apps uh that
were bypassing google plays uh update
features
uh basically kind of a danger for people
um garmin got
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] recently uh anyone that has a
garmin device probably knows that
uh they ended up paying the ransomware
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you garmin
quit ruining it for the rest of us quit
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] paying people you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] morons
um alexa pond my enemies so uh there's a
really cool
post about a guy a group of people i
guess maybe who uh
uh wind up submitting 234 skills that
violate these skills like terms
and they all get approved some of them
took more than once to go in but they
did
uh let's see avon the makeup company uh
they got breached uh
no i'm sorry they leaked some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
because they didn't secure their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh
what did this include full name phone
number
date of birth email home address gps
coordinates and uh 40 000 security
tokens some internal ship
promo.com got breached uh let's see that
contained 22 million user records on
file
uh let's see the compromise data and so
it's in there [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh approximate user
location your ip address first last name
your email address your encrypted hash
salted password so yeah i guess that's
nice
cwt got breached let's see one of these
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get
uh let's see oh they paid the ransom
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you cwt
um they the attackers initially demanded
10 million but they haggled them down to
4.5
so go you i guess ohio actually did a
pretty cool thing
uh they've got a vulnerability
disclosure policy for
election related websites so not
election [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but election related
websites it's a start
okay um have i been pwned is going open
source
uh troy hug tried to sell it because
he's tired of running it that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
didn't work
so i guess he figured he'd open source
it
i don't know contribute it's a cool
project but
shot time and katrina made
some toasted ravioli and she made it
early and then she's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like she
smells so good uh okay snapdragon of the
toaster ravioli not the vodka
uh checkpoint found a bunch of uh
details of snapdragon processors which
is in like every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
uh android phone ever um
and they patched it but it's what's it
gonna get to you
so capital one hey they had a settlement
um
i'm gonna let you read my math i mean
i'm pretty math idiotic but i think that
checks out
um my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with google plus is worth
twelve dollars you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
proctor you had a breach so these uh
this affected
uh like accounts from 2015 back um
and yeah what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man uh this had
unencrypted passwords what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
proctor you you guys [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck
uh intel just had 20 gigabytes of files
uh
leaked or breached nobody really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
knows actually just
there's 20 gigabytes of stuff that some
of it says like restricted
and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that so there's people way
smarter than me parsing you
uh there's a black hat talk on satellite
communications and
we all assume that like oh you can
probably listen in on satellite comics
it probably takes like much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
money or some really cool tools
uh the tools are cool but they only cost
like 300 so
there's that um google was uh testing
out some like security stuff
uh they they uh this guy fire
in his house they found it and that's
how we learned about
google's merger acquisition of adt so
that's cool
ultra lock uh opens with just a mac
address so this is an interesting post
from
someone i've already forgotten about uh
and then they found out this the
blog author actually found out oh like
by the way pentest partners figured out
that these guys
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up everywhere uh ether oops is a
thing
so uh it has a logo um basically this uh
this relies on i got a dog in here
that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the ground i
don't know what it is
uh uh this involves uh exploiting faults
in ethernet cables
uh let's see zello that is a uh thing
that allows you
uh let's see first responders
hospitality services transportation
people use it
um they might have gotten email
addresses and hashed passwords they
don't say
what the password hashes are though so
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if i know what that is
uh maze ransomware uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up lg and
xerox pretty recently
so they got what uh 50.2 gigabytes from
lg
25.8 gigabytes of xerox uh i got a bunch
of crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from lg
not so much for xerox i put
this slide in there to give myself a
all right let's get some tools um link
lock this is a thing where you can
essentially uh send someone an encrypted
url
i don't really understand how this is uh
like any easier than [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
like why wouldn't you just use signal i
mean you just send it over a different
secure channel anyway it's a thing
uh cigarette that's a big windows thing
that you probably patched by now and if
you haven't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you you really should
have bro
uh any any windows dns server it should
be patched should have been patched like
yesteryear man uh defcon ctf archive is
live so these cats
are currently running the defcon ctf and
they were like hey let's put all the old
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up there so if you're looking for
some fun [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do
maybe check out that defcon ctf archive
give them a little bit of biznass
uh boot goal is the other thing hey it's
got a logo it must be serious
uh this is uh vulnerability and grub 2
boot loaders so
again in order to actually exploit this
you kind of already have to have a
situation where you're already
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but this does permit persistence
hey shot time
i wish i had put in a slide here for
toasted ravioli time
i wish i'd quit pouring vodka on my
pants shots
they all are still well behaved they
didn't take away the
stuff uh feston and that's the thing
uh if you want to be famous and find
some of these unsecured uh s3 buckets
and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
go download that go hack some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i bet
it works
uh intel owl that's a pretty neat thing
i've been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with at work actually
um that single pane of glass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
like if you just want to paste something
into a thing and be like hey
show me stuff about that thing check out
intel
owl it's not bad uh root shark is a
thing where you feed it p
caps and it tries to give you
interesting stuff in those peak apps
um which i guess is pretty cool i
haven't actually [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with this yet
but
came across my feeds and it's i like
giving you tools
this is funny to me because i saw this
happen live so i had a bunch of users
reporting emote [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to me
i went to go look at some of the older
links like a day later and i saw these
gifts and i'm like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i'm
gonna see a blog post about this in a
month
it only took like two weeks so whoever's
doing that you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome i will
buy you a drink at defcon
uh see data this is a company that makes
uh
fiber to the home boxes so these are
things that your isp probably drops in
places
they got a bunch of like hard-coded back
doors in them because this company's a
dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
uh chrome for whatever reason just
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hates
the url bar uh so basically uh now
they're only showing the domain so
like i got this story off android police
it's only shown androidpolice.com even
though
androidpolice.com and www.are different
things
did you know it was world password day
at some point between now
and whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] our last meeting
was
you do now so that was the thing go tell
people
what a good password is it's a
passphrase uh so the internet archive is
uh
currently hosting like 1.4 million books
for people like downloading [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're
like hey pandemic this shit's crazy
uh y'all should take a look at this um
and now they're getting sued
so i don't really know where i sit on
this copyrights suck dick
uh and hey if you haven't read this uh
marcus hutchins
the the wannacry savior and as it turns
out the
uh uh kronos bandit one in the same
check it out read that story it's pretty
interesting to hear it from his uh
point of view and uh that my friends
