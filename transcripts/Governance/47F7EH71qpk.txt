I know I'm the worst I already said that
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] alright ok I actually have to back
off they're telling me this has never
happened before I was told to eat this
mic like a weiner and that is what I do
alright so those of you that don't know
me my name is Aaron Scanlon
I do the news this is a bunch of the
things that the news is here we're going
to see if my timings are working well
enough or not I'm pretty sure they work
oh thank [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all right so if you want
these links they're going to be posted
there in the slag I haven't done it yet
I will when I get on stage it's gonna be
fun
also it's my 9 year wedding anniversary
and I'm here because I love you alright
you have yes we got 60 million records
that were exposed USPS didn't do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to
Brian Krebs talk to him about it was a
budget made bi that allowed them to get
bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like your address and your
phone number and all this other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we
got another creation PO Box this is a
bunch of text message database I was
full of everything from like one-time
pins to shipping notifications
everything in between each record was
meticulously tagged in detailed these
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] left it exposed
wonder what else is new I mean we've
seen this a lot each tree of health had
quite possibly the worst health care
breach of the year up to date so far if
they find the findings are correct
something like two point six five
million bits of information there with
all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gone damn it was a
third-party vendor that lost all that
Marriott International toaster fire has
gone on for a while it's only 383
compromised records not 500 million
there's also twenty five point five
million passports 5.25 million of those
being unencrypted [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my life offends
one of me
we had a password manager get
compromised so basically every one that
was registered prior to January 6
2018 yeah all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that you get
is gone now they encrypted the password
so that's good but it's still not good
Clinton gum actually does get big
compromise they've come back and said
you know we've tried to patch this we
don't know why this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is still
vulnerable interestingly enough Topeka
Kansas is one of the affected cities so
if you pay utility bills if you live in
Topeka oops
you might want to stop turn up Salem is
some game that is the hot new rage all
of their credentials were stolen
recently the passwords are in the form
of a PHP pass md5 md5 and yeah so
they've already cracked like 27% of
those I believe Cora which is like some
budget ask Yahoo Answers 100 million
records stolen
thank God let's see the passwords were
we're also Krypton with their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
encrypted so that's good but still
there's a federal shutdown going on
right now you can go to pretty much any
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] website that's useful for his
blue teamers from the feds and can't hit
it right now I feel like it would have
taken less resources you just keep that
ship online but first major flaw Cooper
Eddy's was found so again it's not that
you know it's above the crease bed now
no it's just look like this is the first
big one so hey make note of it if you've
got an environment [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] patch it
basically it made it so that an
authorised first [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nevermind we've
got some people that were snooping in on
EU diplomatic cables so I guess someone
fished some representatives from the
country of Cyprus and then they listed
in the other communications so then you
know what what you gonna do Cyprus is
going to site I can't even make that one
up so it's like all right maybe you can
understand the concepts of security and
never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] use a computer an envier
okay it's probably as bad as it sounds
though all right
Amazon so we've seen misconfigured s3
buckets be at the root of a lot of these
data breaches and it's not even the
Amazons [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fault and they are doing
more to make it so that you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
can't do it it's awesome so they're
making it even more difficult for you to
bank your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] public Microsoft had a
couple of MFA outages over the course of
November so two major ones actually the
second moment right after they got done
explaining the first one this it's
alright then it happens it's good to
know that you have a back-up plan god
damn it
let's see Oh bro Brazil got compromised
by not one but two card skimmers the
first part skimmer was just human cards
second part skimmer was like ah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
that first card skimmer and they started
sending them bad cards man
yes so this isn't bad actually this is
probably one of the coolest pieces of
research I've seen in the past couple of
months
I mean if awesome turned on on reversing
these super easy Starling I'm pretty
sure Julie has a car with one of these
in it so I mean hey was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] YouTube
while we're driving around legit it's
because Lauren has dammit
3b 3b he got taken down huge and fraud
rig basically like 1 billion plus IP
addresses doing an ad fraud ring content
of lots of money but your printers got
compromised too this time SPRO bunch of
Pro PewDiePie propaganda apparently he's
not going to be like the most subscribe
to YouTube channel soon alright you know
hey better this is an anti-semitic stuff
I guess but again what are we going to
learn we see this year after year after
year yeah that happened to the
Australian government just doesn't give
a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about your secure communications
and that's fine I guess we'll see what
happens it's probably gonna spell bad
things for us thanks to the five eyes
agreement that our government has with
them as well let's see we've got a
report here from I don't remember which
company talking about this group called
London blue they are ABEC scam ring so
they've gone and you know profiled all
these people think it's the weird thing
about these guys is that they operate
like a real business with like sales
management the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here is yet another
report it's time on a group that's
called the bean called stolen pencil
real cool they targeted academia so near
and dear to my heart
University yeah basically they were
installing key loggers and going after
credentials what else is deal
Australia's from the early warning to
work alert system attack this isn't
government-run but they do they are like
the upstream for a lot of government
systems really early wanting so like
brush fires and stuff they learn people
to really bad faith there they you just
attacked so my bad Crawford is actually
going to tell you a little bit more
about this later on there are a lot of
issues with the digitizing of DNA so I'm
definitely not going to talk a lot about
that because the other aaron is going to
do that but it's still really cool
talking enough tonight
ESET is giving us a teardown on OpenSSH
back doors they actually started looking
at these a few years ago and wound up
discovering a bunch of them that don't
need known to exist yet so this report
contains about three years worth of
research on all of that
oh let's see we've got the Nomad a
exploit kit as a story getting home in
Soho routers not necessarily in the US
just yet but basically it gets a
foothold through one user making them
download runs of dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] then it
tries to exploit your router and hijack
your DNS settings and that's buckle for
everyone else we have a nice round of
fishing with a side of a bomb threat I
know a couple of higher ed institutions
have that happen this is a spin on the
sextortion scam so at this time they
said we're going to blow you up with I
don't know blow up the compound II think
thank Bob things turned up at the border
agents are pretty bad need hygiene so
they have searched a twenty five
thousand people's phones coming in and
out of the
last year turns out they don't believe
that data whenever they want to so net
News Bears
we had someone gets caught stealing from
Langley Air Force Base over the course
of like was it from 2001 to 2008 een
some 17 years stealing a 1.7 million
dollars but they didn't find it
yeah how can you get that long so you
can't get it right now because of the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] federal shutdown the House
Oversight Committee report on the
epithets breach holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
get a hold of that whenever the girl
comes back because it's an amazing read
like should be mandatory for blue team
trip Micro has released a report talking
about how shitty Hall of EPN is
essentially so they detailed numerous
false claims that law bpn makes
essentially whole of India that is an
unencrypted web proxy not a VPN let's
see Microsoft released and out of an
patch for Internet Explorer so again you
know shit's bad whatever Mike results
like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] alright here you guys go this
happened right before you know Christmas
so lots of fun for the enterprises out
there we had a huge trove of data drop
that implicates a lot of German
politicians so it's kind of a lot of
info from a lot of really we are what we
suspect are a lot of different sources
just because of all of the different
data that's in there but there
a lot of knowledge about where it came
from this is a really cool tool that got
dropped
ipv6 66 the address of the beast
basically that doesn't exist in ipv6
there's some interesting things about
ipv6 that I didn't know until I read
about this tool check it out I highly
encourage reversing apks is generally
pretty easy to do you've got paid for
tools but it's less easy if you're
working in the free space this guy
decided that sucks and made something
that will turn an apk into an Android
studio project very quickly we've got a
google translator reverse shell tools so
this does exactly what it sounds
basically you've got a machine that has
a talking out to Google Translate and
you've got a list of method then
receives that info doing something like
voice processing component the Google
Translate does so kind of cool let's see
we got a new TCP / DNS mechanism called
Thunder DNS so they compared this
against DNS cat to iodine DNS to TCP
heyoka and awesome and DNS it wasn't as
fast as iodine but it was more fault
tolerant than all of those solutions so
kind of cool on CAPTCHA tube came out
and Google was made aware of that but
that's okay they said go ahead and
release it so I imagine they're going to
change how caption works in the very
near future we'll see though I have no
insider information there I think this
is a boy
they have my timer didn't work for this
because it was again that's what I get
faster [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this
I told that we would take ten minutes
all right we've got to do reverse proxy
we're back on schedule it's fine it's
called a lot lishka it's designed for
use with cell fishing exercises I was
built to go it has built-in support for
2fa fishing very nice stuff get it it's
cool
the NSA is going to lead release intra
in March at the RSA conference here in
2019 Ichiro was first heard about from
the CIA vault 7 Elise it is a java-based
reverse engineering toolkit we'll see
what that is soon and then finally be
European file at GDP are requested
Amazon get that sweet personal data also
get one point seven thousand voice files
that aren't mine my reaction when that
and then is the dudes
[Applause]
