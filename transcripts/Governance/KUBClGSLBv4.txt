all right all right
set case c let's hear it let's hear for
[Music]
bill
all right so hey i want to introduce our
first speaker um but i have a little bit
of a story so
so i went to dave the dave cochrane over
here he's going to be our first speaker
and i said
what do you want me to to say when i
introduce you he's a very humble man
didn't want me to do much slow what i
did is i went on the internet
and i googled dave cochran kansas city
so i could give
uh you know so i have a little bit of
your background served so i could give
you
you know a good story and what i found
was a very heartwarming story
i found that we are in the presence of a
celebrity
it turns out in january 2019
a a homeless man driving a car with with
just trash bags for windows was driving
to the chief's game
and and found a a car pulled over on the
side
and there was a chiefs player who was
stuck and dave cochran pulled that man
out not knowing that he was the chief
player
and sit him on his way so sir i realize
that's not you but there is another day
and when i run in that man i'll show you
i am minnesotan it's an easy mistake
anyway
um i do want to i do want to give you a
good a good proper introduction
so so dave cochran here um he is we were
just talking earlier and if you haven't
if you have kids that are into building
robots or something after the talk come
and meet him
he's a coach for uh lego world
from world's lego league and they made
it all the way to the finals in fact i
think they won they brought home the
trophy
i saw the uh i saw the championship so
anyway with that
let's hear it for our first speaker of
tonight dave got
[Applause]
dust check check check check check check
yeah he turned the mic off which is just
fantastic of him
all right so this is my users can't
infosec and it's everybody else's fault
but
mine a couple things before we begin
first off fun choice i am intentionally
using comic sans for two reasons
reason number one reason number one it
is proven
to be more legible to people with
uh dyslexia and other similar
uh learning disabilities reason number
this talk is not gonna be very very
technical it's not gonna be be
super fun super exciting there's not
going to be anything exploding i hope
it's also not meant to be an indictment
of any one person in the room
or even any community in the room so
much as
kind of uh hey we could probably be
doing this different and better and
maybe we should
um which is what this talk is i'm
getting ahead of myself how are you all
doing tonight
i'm not nervous you're nervous
so without further ado let's answer
johnny the tackling alzheimer's patient
who am i
yay technology you know what we're just
or not why are you technical
difficulties one second
you know i swear to god i did rehearse
this
i mean i could but it wouldn't be nearly
as fun
yeah just a second or three here
see this folks is why you want to use
new technology and not the old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
there we go give me just a moment get
this loaded back up and we'll be on our
way i promise i can even start from the
yeah like technology's always worked for
go get down well he's working
on his i.t issues let's see some hands
uh
who's this is your first time in second
let me see some hands
oh we got one right here all right
hey why don't you yell when you got that
going hello
what's your name it's going tyler who
brought you to
casey
make sure
so you brought tyler to that kc good job
i'll buy you a drink
you too all right let's give this stuff
oh he brought him too
all right well hey actually dave i've
got a little bit of a uh
admission here so if you guys don't know
we have here a little tradition although
i'm wondering if we should maybe get
past that first slide
before we give this big vision anyway
if it's your first time speaking a set
it's not a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right
all right so i promised i'd start on the
right slide so maybe we should
so answering johnny the tackling alan
thomas patient who is this guy anyway
i have an associate's degree in computer
forensics
i have a bachelor's degree in computer
forensics
over a decade in retail which don't do
that
i am currently an interface engineer in
a big healthcare
i.t company in the local area that is
not in any way shape or form responsible
for sponsoring or even in most cases
aware of
the fact that i am doing this tonight i
can neither confirm nor deny that sir
all right so the whole point of this
talk is that
we in information security are not
really
good at getting people to do
the infosec things and we can prove that
by the fact that we had how many slides
was it with the news like 5 000 or
so there's a couple of reasons that this
is a recurring consistent problem that i
have found with
you know a few google searches and like
uh way too much time on twitter
first off logic is not nearly as
intuitive for people as we want to think
it is
this is from august of 2017
sorry july 2017 then prime minister
malcolm turnbull of australia
was asking a bunch of companies
for some backdoors in their
cryptographic algorithms
and they said we can't give you a
backdoor and still have it be secure
it's mathematically impossible it would
be against the rules of mathematics
to which he replied well you know it's
great and all but in australia i'm not
doing accents because
you don't want to hear that trust me
it's great and all but in australia the
only laws that apply
and then there's the fact that people
are really bad at computers and
and there's a bunch of people in the
audience right now sysadmins and
helpdesk
are going duh but um
no really people people are not good at
computers
uh a couple examples here
this is presented without comment the
secret kc is a non-partisan organization
the presenters views do not necessarily
etc etc etc but donald trump refuses to
use a secure landline because he really
cyber is hard you are completely correct
all right more people than that no db
come on
okay there we go so a couple weeks ago
months ago whatever's ago i forget when
i made this slide deviant
did this deviant went to send a sexy
snapchat picture to his wife and he
he claims it wasn't too revealing i
believe he's still employed so he's
probably right
but i mean if somebody like him who's
basically an
a a red team celebrity can still [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
there's not really a lot of hope for the
rest of us
so here's the mean of the presentation
this is where if you're taking notes
you're going to want to get your
highlighters you go into circle stuff
underline everything this is a study
done by the organization for economic
cooperation and development which is a
club of industrialized countries
uh they asked questions of 215
942 people in
uh 33 countries between the years 2011
and 2015
with at least 5 000 people in each
country
they graded people based on their
responses to this test which i'm going
to get into the details in a second
level three would be
if you were able to complete the task
the test they were given
you want to know what percentage of the
emails
sent by john smith last month
were about sustainability if you could
get that answer you are in the top
5 of computer users
in 33 countries
all right level two would be the task
given
you want to find a sustainability
related document
that was sent to you by john smith in
october
level one find email
that's 29. i should point out by the way
these are the uh
the oecd average scores that i'm showing
right now
uh we'll do the us once in a second um
and then the the sub one level is
and that's 14. now i got i got to be
honest i kind of lied there is another
level
to the to the scale here
the people who just can't use a computer
just straight up
i don't know how to use a computer and
uh
so on the global scale
40 of people are at or below the level
of computer user where delete this email
is an achievable goal
people are not good at computers
i promise the u.s scores here they are
we're a little bit better arguably
um we have fewer people who can't use
computers at all
but if you notice the top two categories
are basically the same i think there
might be a percentage point or two
difference but
by and large they're pretty much the
same
so i started thinking myself you know
i've got these two degrees granted
they're sequential but i've got these
two degrees
in computer forensics what kind of
things do i have trouble with
what kind of things make me pause and go
advancing slides is really tough you're
very clever
have a cookie so i came up with a bunch
of things that don't
actually help users but that we think
help users
i can barely delete an email
um i'm pretty sure the screenshots from
firefox because that's about all i use
um and it's just saying you know hey the
security certificate has expired you can
go forward if you want to but
we don't recommend it and i said okay
that's great firefox
but um um
um firefox you don't have the best uh
best track record with with security
certs and the
keeping up to date thereof
now that shot's going to your head not
mine
um but security search in general are a
personal peep
of mine because i suck at
updating cas at getting the good certs
and not
using the bad ones every time i try and
update the ca it takes me like three or
four tries i usually [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up each
time and then i have to go either find
like a 20-minute youtube video
and you know learn how to do it and
still [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up once or twice or get a
friend to walk me through it
and i'm arguably in the target audience
for this kind of thing
admittedly i don't do security stuff on
a daily basis
but i'm arguably still in that target
audience this should be the kind of
thing that i am at least
okay at and i will grant
absolutely grant that it should not be
an
easy thing to do right we don't want
people going in and double clicking on
something and all of a sudden they have
all the security sorts ever because that
way lies
bad but it could still be a lot easier
to
do and nobody seems to be caring to take
the time to make it
easier for anyone at all
it was hard for me why should it be easy
for you yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that attitude man
uh other things that don't help this is
a prominent infosec person who i will
not name
because i did not get their permission
to use them as an example of the bad
i recognize that the topic of the tweet
has
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all to do with infosec generally
speaking
but if i am a user who has
trouble deleting emails which as
previously established is
at least 40 of the population
and i see this and this person is in
charge of security at my organization
i don't feel confident going to them and
saying i might have done a bad
can you help me that seems like a really
really bad idea to me all of a sudden
because this person has clearly
expressed
that they don't really care
to educate or to help or to teach
at least based on this one tweet there
are many more from the same person
that display the opposite but i might
not have access to that i might not have
visibility to that i might not know how
to find
those other tweets because i have
trouble deleting
email
like it was 2018 like it was yesterday
says the guy in the corner thank you guy
in the corner i appreciate the
assistance
something very very fun i i say fun
incredibly wrongly happened on january
13
of 2018 whole bunch of people
got a text message if you lived in
hawaii
that said hey north korea just shot a
bunch of nukes at you
it turned out to be a false alarm but
nobody knew that
for a good few hours
of terror and panic because
and here's why this happened that's the
interface
actually i'm kind of like that's the new
version of the interface
um they added a link
the the red link is is what they uh
what they actually clicked the yellow
link is what they should have clicked
and the green one at the top is the new
one that they added so that this doesn't
raise your hand if you think that there
was any sort of are you sure you want to
send a get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out message to
of course not oh and there's there's a
there's another reason
by the way uh hiema is the hawaii
emergency management agency in case
anyone cares
um there's another reason that the panic
the governor could remember his twitter
password
there are opportunities everywhere
is is the takeaway that i'm trying to
get at now i mentioned
at the very beginning of this that i've
got over a decade of retail experience
which i still don't recommend
this is the part where i'm
self-deprecating
when i was working retail one of the
things that i did is i would sell
electronic stuff to people who had
no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clue how to use it
they would come in and they would say i
can you be more specific no
okay let's talk
i'm not going to stand here and tell you
that
anyone that i sold a camera to has ever
been featured in national geographic's
you know
annual best pictures of the whatever
companion because
that would be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and while i do
tell a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's not
something i'm willing to go to
uh but they did at least learn
something they walked out confident that
they could turn the machine
on and use it for its intended purpose
and maybe even do some neat other stuff
with it or show off some features to
because i would talk to them i actually
got in trouble
for talking to people too much because
no you can't be sitting there talking to
the customers you have to make the sale
then go back to whatever you're doing
talking to the customer is what i was
doing no no not that the other thing
again don't work retail it's it's not
but do maybe because it helps you learn
how to
talk to people which i think we can all
agree
i made it funny so
how do we get past this particular
hurdle how do we get people to listen to
us
and do what we want them to do well
first thing that i can think of
is that we need to work on our messages
uh you don't want to use the same super
in-depth technical explanation
when you know great uncle harry
comes up to you at thanksgiving and says
hey so tell me about this here
uh two factor something i have your
grammar
that you would use with the person
sitting next to you tonight because
great uncle harry doesn't know
from joe um similarly
i thought this was a really really good
you want to make sure that the people
that you're giving a message to
the c-suite is different from peers is
different from
relatives is different from your pet
is different from etc etc etc
what else can we do well better
communication and better tools which are
both
really easy to say i completely
acknowledge i know that
and not necessarily easy to do
but i mean most of us probably aren't
even
trying when 40 of our users have trouble
deleting an email i'm going to keep
hammering this point because it's a
really really good point to him
uh one thing that i've noticed
personally is that a lot of us tend to
think
that good communication means precise
communication and that's not necessarily
going to be the case all the time or
even most of the time
precise can be good can be helpful
but a lot of the time it just gets
people confused especially
if they are the kind of people that have
trouble deleting emails they don't care
about the difference between shot 256
and shot 512
or sha128 or whatever else
they just want to know how to not get
their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] which is a completely fair goal
to have um
so there's going to be some counter
arguments i can already tell people are
going to come up and they're going to
say okay but
how do i make them understand why we
need them to do this
and i'm going to respond right now in
advance
have you tried talking to them
have you tried listening to them because
a lot of times the questions that we
think we hear
are not really the questions that people
actually have
the best question the best response to
anything that someone comes up to me and
asks me for information on that i can
think of
is show me what you need
because we've all had somebody who came
up to us and said the computer doesn't
work
okay what do you mean by that and it
turns out that they were just having
trouble getting to the right homepage
or that their monitor was unplugged or
that they couldn't print because
printers are you know the devil's
anywhere
but if you got to actually understand
what they are
asking before you can answer their
question and help them progress
and if you can't delete an email you
might have trouble explaining what it is
you mean quickly and concisely and for
all you know the computer
actually is broken but you have to ask
the right questions
another kind of argument people might
bring up is how do i get them to do what
i say
again people are willing
for the most part to learn and to adapt
and to
use new skills but they have
it's a lot easier to get them to do that
when you give them a reason
to do that that they can internalize
because we said so is not a great reason
who here has seen the uh correct horse
i know there's more people than that
i showed that to my mom last night
because she was very very proud of her
10 character uppercase lowercase numbers
and symbols
password that she is for website
and i had to tell her that doesn't
necessarily make it secure here's the
thing
she texted me this morning she said okay
you know what i completely understand
what you were saying that was a very
good explanation
you gotta meet people where they're at
not where you want them to be you're not
the quarterback lobbing the football to
the receiver you're handing it off to
and then of course well why should i do
any of this why do i care
because we're in information security
for one of two reasons possibly both
reason number one
paycheck reason number two
ultimately like maybe that's not i'm
gonna go into work today and help people
but that's the reason that we went in
there a lot of us
is we want to make the users experience
better we want to make people
safer we want to keep [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from getting
owned
that's helping people that's why we're
you are in fact at least a teeny bit
at fault for the fact that your users
can't induce that but you can help them
get better if you really really want to
i mentioned earlier i work for
and most of my clients most of people i
talk to are doctors and nurses
i don't want my doctor to be an
information security professional i want
my doctor to be a medical
professional when my doctor and nurse
clients call me up and say hey this
thing isn't working what the hell
that's okay it's good in my mind
that they aren't 100 familiar with all
these things
and that they need help understanding
them and being doctors and nurses are
probably not that dumb
probably there are exceptions but
probably
but they're able to learn they're able
to adapt
but that shouldn't be their focus that's
our focus that's why we have the jobs we
do
that's the last bit here i saw this the
other night i thought it was a great
message
you can fight your peers or you can work
with them but it's easier when you work
i've been dave cochran this has been my
i'm just about to lose my
i wanna love you guys
[Laughter]
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
[Music]
did you really yeah on the website i
missed it on the announcement page right
below
what's up mommy hey man hey you been
losing weight i'm trying working
good thanks uh how long are you gonna go
15 20 minutes okay or maybe sign a full
signal five ten minutes
yeah okay anything you want me to say or
just make up whatever i want to say
oh make it okay it's good i mean what
watch this
this is actually not a deep dive we're
going to stay right on the surface like
this guy
everybody everybody
right so this is an introduction don't
haggle me
i'm just going right across the surface
okay so you not want me to heckle you
okay it'll probably throw me way off but
i need to i need that sort of like a
test me man well i asked him i was like
are you okay with him
or me heckling you and he's kind of like
yeah that's why he didn't look ready
and
[Music]
um
well let me go make sure that it's all
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
okay all right give me that mic
all right we got about five minutes but
i thought i was gonna start uh
real quick i'm gonna ask some trivia
questions here who's ready for some
trivia
[Applause]
all right how many long life or set kc
life risk do we have in the house
oh we got a few got a few all right
who can tell me where was the first set
kc held
no i think i heard it over here
it wasn't gerts it was coaches we got
we got it coaches all right where is
setkc
yes it is the hearts and minds of all
that exists that's right caleb
that's right all right
let's see how many locations has that kc
five five the answer is five kansa is
our fifth
location and we're never leaving
all right um what is the correct way to
pronounce set kc
that's right that's my favorite trivia
question
um who came up with the idea of set
casey
well that was a very wow were you part
oh my gosh that oh that's the next one
okay who came up with
it uh that person was alex flowerman on
a flight back from defcon it was defcon
14 i think all right so who came up with
the idea of set kc
that's right it was me it was bill
smeartoon i'm sorry um one of our
bartenders names
what
it's actually cat
where well it's a cat
all right oh this is a good one um what
is the first name of the guy who is
most likely to steal your watch at set
kc
no no not bill that's on number two
gene that's right it's gene all right
with that
let's go ahead and introduce our next
speaker this is caleb christopher
all right we're going to learn all there
is to know
we're going to do a super deep dive into
cryptography
who who of you looked at the set kc
website
um and saw caleb's description
did anybody decode that raise your hand
don't yell it out
all right i'm gonna get it over you
ready go get
kale thanks man
[Applause]
start my timer here well
in case you didn't decrypt that it's
base64 go figure it out
it'll be fun it's like a field trip
right do it on your phone right now
okay so one thing i want you to know
right from the start
you're excited to be here okay now this
is going to be
a big deal those of you who are familiar
with this clip will understand what i'm
saying
this is actually not a deep dive we're
staying right on the surface of the
issue okay
we are not going to crack through the
ice and get into the mathematics or any
of that junk
i get headaches trying to read books
about that stuff i've got a
certification
about encryption dude don't go there
let's stay at the surface level all
right this is an
introduction
very well okay so what i want to do
i'm going to introduce this is the
problem right cryptography is obviously
the answer
but how do we use it how do we get the
answers
we've got three questions how do you
talk privately to someone
in a crowded room let me hear some
answers how do you do that
that's right different languages right
so if i want to know how to have a
private conversation with bill bill do
you speak croatian
yes for this example you do okay
does anyone else speak croatian thank
you
we're going to say for this example no
all right you get you
following me now so bill now you and i
can talk in an open room other people
can hear it they can
know what we're saying without
understanding it they can that's how
encryption works all right that's what i
want to do
that's the problem we have to solve now
we need to solve in real life across the
internet
how do you know that what you said or
what the other person said hasn't
changed
right so if we switch to written
messages and he has to write a note like
in
elementary school in middle school and
pass it to me we have to trust other
people to hand that message across
and all the way up here to the stage how
do i know that
from the time it left his hands to the
time it comes into my hands it hasn't
changed
that's one of the problems we're going
to solve with cryptography and then how
do i prove who said what
how do i know that bill is actually the
one that sent that message
right these are the questions we want to
answer with this talk
all right you get into the definition
stuff here blah blah blah basically i
want to keep private stuff private right
we can solve more problems like we just
saw in the previous slide
but but
here's the exciting part so google has
been tracking the use of the word
cryptography since 1800
okay so that's 1800 right there
right about there really low low usage
right
not a lot of people talking about it
they want to send a private message they
walk down
to their neighbor and talk okay this is
1900
right about here there's a little
plateau so
during that plateau i just googled some
stuff to figure out what was going on
just out of curiosity
your mileage may very interpret it how
you want interesting things
at that time i found there was the box
of rebellion
the formation of the irish party the
world's first wireless transmission that
certainly wasn't encrypted but maybe
they were thinking about it maybe they
search google
uh mckinley was shot and the socialist
revolutionary party was started
so there's a bunch of relatively
sensitive topics maybe it came up at
that time
and then in the late 1900s
we see this huge spike why any ideas
wrong a man named bruce schneer
wanted to sell some books and get some
speaking engagements so
he spam the google search results to
make it really popular
he succeeded in his mission and then
what do you think happened right there
he retired
and then it dropped off sharply and then
right around the 2010s we had
the rise of bitcoin and ransomware and
people are re-interested in cryptography
right now if you don't know bruce
schneer
you want a deep dive go read one of his
books he is one of the the leading minds
in cryptography okay
i was kidding he's a respectable man
so if you forget nothing out there if
you remember nothing else
from this talk what do we want from
crypto
cryptography pain that's right
did you say it in english all right
it's all about pain p
privacy confidentiality
a authenticity we want to know who said
what
if that was really the person who said
it i integrity
i want to know that the message hasn't
changed from its original state and in
non-repudiation this is very closely
linked with
authenticity but it's more of a legal
concept again guys don't skid me
i'm standing right at the top of that
layer of ice we're not going down into
the pool into the freezing water
okay p-a-i-n what's it about
what's cryptography for everybody
this is painful everybody say pain at
the same time what is cryptography
there we go it is painful to study too
okay visual aids cryptography
brings pain that's a paintball gun on
the right and a man in the shower
do you want to talk about pain okay
we have some key terms here i'm slapping
because i didn't put this in my speaker
notes and i'm looking at a blank screen
i only have speaker notes on some slides
so note to self play text this is the
easiest one
it says what it is right a cipher this
is
an algorithm with which you encrypt
plaintext the ciphertext is the text
that has gone through
a cipher we get what's called a message
digest from a hash function
now this is essentially a one-way
encryption that's not meant to be
reversed
okay cracking
not the same thing as reversing
we're going to spend a lot of time on
these two here because we want to solve
that for those problems of communicating
privately
and maintaining we want to achieve full
pain right so
a symmetric key this is synonymous with
you'll see all sorts of these just know
that they're all talking about symmetric
key
encryption private key shared key
session key secret key
all four of those five of those mean the
same thing
okay now here's the thing with symmetric
cryptography that's what that's me and
bill talking
in croatian we both know what each other
is saying it's very fast and easy for us
to speak
a language that we know natively
computers can do the same thing
with encryption the problem anybody
what's the problem with symmetric
cryptography
distribution of keys yes sharing
passwords etc
same thing so how do i tell bill what
language to speak
without any of you knowing that's the
problem
and that's a scalability issue for
symmetric key
encryption now it is very efficient
that's one of the
big benefits asymmetric cryptography
you'll see public key cryptography pki
public key infrastructure this is a
what happens here is we generate a key
key pair
private very good and you have a public
key which you publish this is
counterintuitive to some people why
would i publish my key
the way it works is something that is
encrypted with one key
can only be decrypted with the other key
so i want to publish a public key and
let you encrypt things with my public
key so that only i can
decrypt that that achieves
confidentiality across an open medium
so let's look at it this way as an
example
uh you there with with the boxers yes i
can tell you're my example person right
here
so let's say you have an imaginary lock
box
and i have a padlock and i chuck my
imaginary padlock out to you and you
catch it without getting hit in the face
now you can write whatever message you
want inside that steel lock box
drop it in there and then lock it with
my padlock and then you can have other
people
your mules carry it to me when it gets
up on stage and i
unlock that box i'm the only one with
the key then i can read your message can
anybody else read it along the way
not for the purposes of our example okay
this is a very simple illustration of
how some
asymmetric cryptography works
now the same is true digitally
in the reverse it's not quite the same
in real life with physical lock boxes
right but i can encrypt something with
my private key
that then anyone can decrypt with my
public key
why would we want to do that
yes because something that is
encrypted with my private key can only
be decrypted with my what
public key that means i must be the one
who wrote that message
there's your authenticity so
then we get some other terms cia very
common term abbreviation
whatever you call those in uh insecurity
confidentiality integrity and
availability
we're always trying to keep those three
it's a balancing act
and then we have pain what's that stand
for
p privacy authenticity
integrity and non-repudiation
it's very similar to asymmetric right
it's like half asymmetric
cryptography i can take
a large file put it through a hash
function and a
fixed size block of text comes out that
represents
that file if you change anything within
that file
the output of the hash function changes
that's the purpose of hashing so i can
send you a file
send you what the hash output was tell
you what algorithm to use
and when you receive the file you run it
through a hashing function as well
and if it matches bingo you got the
right file
if it does not match then that has been
again symmetric key this is
not scalable sorry i get mixed up on
these
so talking up here by the way any one of
you could have given this talk
all right just a couple of hours of
study so let's hear let's have some more
talk submissions on
intro stuff so we get more speakers up
here
so submit your key achieves
confidentiality but not all the other
stuff
it's fast but it has problems with key
distribution
asymmetric we achieve non-repudiation
with this
we can and it is very easy to distribute
keys
because you publish one publicly okay
achieves full pain
all right here's the quiz as a team i
think i got the three questions
okay keep these in mind now what's an
everyday
example of communicating privately
sure web browser very good
are you heckling me this doesn't feel
like heckling i thought you were gonna
heckle me
i studied many years in the amazon
forest of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
you might have done it all right
so if you have a lot of data to transfer
which one do you want to use
which type of encryption symmetric or
asymmetric
symmetric because you have a lot of data
it needs a transfer it needs to be fast
if you're a web server and you have
thousands of clients that you're
connecting to and trying to talk with
which are you preferring asymmetric or
symmetric
symmetric why can't you use symmetric by
itself what's the problem
exchange key distribution it's very
difficult to get those out securely
now if bill and i met privately outside
and discussed
we were going to speak croatian or some
other language then we could do that
privately but that's not possible
on a scalable in a scalable fashion so
how do we handle key distribution
efficiently
we switch to asymmetric
or public key cryptography if we need
integrity non-repudiation and
asymmetric or symmetric asymmetric
public key cryptography so what's the
problem with asymmetric this is just
review
it's slower thank you now
so how do we get the best of both worlds
we use a little something called hybrid
cryptography keep an eye on the colors
here
red for asymmetric so a client obtains
the web server's public key
then that client uses the public key to
encrypt a freshly and
freshly generated private session key
what kind of key is that
symmetric so we use asymmetric to
connect
we generate a symmetric key
we then send that over that
asymmetrically encrypted symmetric key
to the web server and after that we
start using that as a session key why is
it's in use for one session and then
it's discarded
so we just solved our problem so
a visual representation step one you
start with asymmetric step two
remind me one more time what's the word
why why do we want to use for
cryptography what's it all about
pay privacy authenticity integrity
there we go okay
hey how's everybody going anybody drunk
yet
all right so uh we're gonna give a quick
talk
about the b-sides badge the uh
challenges
the challenges that were built into it
so um
not very long i'm gonna run through this
if you went it'll make sense
if not yeah it might make sense yeah go
next year
bucks
so um on the badge this year we went to
a couple different challenges
the first one we had was the beacon
search
and crypto so with the beacon search we
wanted to use the wi-fi that was built
into the badge
so we built in a simple scavenger hunt
we wanted to include the leds in the
scavenger hunt
and we had six leds so we had six wi-fi
so basically when you turned the badge
on it checked if you were at the
conference
and started scanning for those access
points
and it would also save your findings so
we wanted to use a little bit of memory
kind of expand our experience with the
8266 and it will save to eprom so if you
found the first one in the third one and
you shut your badge off
you don't have to start over with first
so initially when you turned the badge
on it had a site a cylon
kind of pattern where it would go back
after about 15 seconds it would turn on
the wi-fi
and check for any of those access points
that were around
now we made the access points we dropped
the power on them as much as we could
so that you'd have to be within about 20
or 30 feet
to pick one up we also put some in
lockers
i threw one in in a bag in the back room
um so try to different things to try to
make it to where you had to search them
down
who who found all the uh
and then once it's scanned it would show
you which ones you found so you'd have
and then it would turn off the wi-fi and
start the cylon
scan again what we did there was using
the wi-fi on the a266 uses up a lot of
power
so we wanted to try to extend that power
throughout the whole day
or two days if we could who had to get a
second set of batteries
and once you found all of them it would
go into random blinky mode
again because we saved all those flags
to the memory
if you turn it off turn it back on you
so if you have a badge right now and you
didn't find all the access points
real simple name and access point batch
pirates zero one three zero six
let the badge find it and then it
we also had a factory reset so we didn't
do it
you're welcome if you if you run an
access point called badge pirates dash
nuke
it will factory reset and forget all
your settings so basically
somebody please do that because i've
seen some some badges around here you
can reset everything
and to cheat and win all of them yeah
there wasn't one we didn't build that in
there
so moving on to the crypto challenge
part
we had two crypto versions one was a red
herring
i know sis aaron who's not here cussed
me out all day
because he kept coming up with red
herring as the decryption
which is what it was the other one was a
bronze fell
cipher so
the grand cell cipher was on the
non-electronic badges so
we had 250 electronic participant badges
plus
a 75 more speaker and
sponsor and other ones those had the red
herring on it
the 500 non-electronic had the actual
cipher on it
if you can't read that that's actually
in case you want to write it down
[Music]
there are because we use a grand spell
there are two keys
a numeric and an alpha and those are
both found
on the badge itself in the copper layer
so they'll be embossed on the back of it
you have
the number up there in the top left one
three three seven
so basically if you decrypt
that encryption you get
an ssid and a password that ssid and a
password
will give you access to an access point
which is currently running
somewhere and on that access point
there's a text-based adventure game
complete that text-based adventure game
and you'll get information on how to
come up to us and give us
so we had one person solve this we had
one person solve this
the first day and i'm very proud of him
and that is that guy so i want to bring
for that guy we are going to give him
one of our uber badges one of the pirate
there were five of these made so
he's got one of them
so the challenge is still alive but you
can't win that because he already won it
i want to also give honorable mentions
to sis erin there
far left archwick zilla
and x mcmillan yeah so sebastian i think
is probably the only person still here
so sebastian come on up we got a
a consolation prize for you too so we'll
put a picture of this out but we did
a challenge accepted completed sao
specifically for these challenges so
uh we only we only had two of these that
the the first two were one
uh one for the counterfeit badge
challenge and then arden for the
for this but we had um
these people they locked themselves in
rooms
to do this so yeah they locked
themselves in the room while everybody
else was out partying
and worked on this crypto challenge and
if you can't tell sis aaron lost his
mind during this thing
so on the badge was there any more
cryptos was there any more challenges on
there
maybe an led sequence maybe the keypads
or the traces
spelled out something maybe maybe not
it didn't sorry those were red herrings
too
we threw some other stuff in there
because we knew people would be looking
at the
led patterns so we tried to hint around
that
and there is some traces on there there
are some pads
that may or may not be used in the
so references um the crypto challenge
the
i have a we have a website uh
cryptochallenges.com
where we have some some crypto
challenges up there that we've done in
the past for set kc
um i have some 101s up there for
different types of crypto
cryptanalysis so if you've never done
any crypto at all
but you think it would be interesting
head to that website and try
some of the one-on-ones i'm going to
have a 101
on a groundsfield crypto on how to solve
it i'm going to use
this as the example of how it could be
solved
and this write-up itself will be on
blog.batchpirates.com
which can also be found on
badmintonpirates.com
i want to go through the match pirates
credits so we've got jiggle billy and
pcor back there our software developers
they worked on the software for the
badges
network did the awesome kids badge you
got to see that there was a laser tag
sharks with lasers on them
[Applause]
white hat steph back there worked on the
game design for the uh
for the tech space adventure and i get
more designs
so after the universe thanks for staying
for the credits
but we heard you little guys love leds
no 650 leds what
so this is going to be our setkc badge
for defcon this year
um look on slack follow us on twitter
we are going to have us a pre-sale for
sec kc members only
for cost i'll give you the code
or cost of this badge you'll get this
badge
or wait until it goes on sale everybody
and pay out
like 20 times as much and i'm gonna
retire after this one
bill only gets one at cost real quick
he's got some
who here knows how to solder who loves
to solder
who's heard of maker faire all right
so we got we got invited this year
to build a learn to solder kit for maker
fair kansas city
so uh in the past uh the make
organization
has uh kind of designed their own learn
to solder kit that
has been used as part of uh maker faire
to kind of teach
uh people how to solder uh during the uh
during the event and this was this is
our design
for um the learn to solder kit for this
year
we've been asked to to kind of help with
running the learn to solder village as
part of maker faire
and we are going to have uh we're doing
a call for volunteers
so if you if you want to go to maker
faire and you don't want to pay to go to
maker faire
this is a great way to do it if you
volunteer for a shift
you will get in the maker faire for free
so
those shifts are going to be uh either
three or four hours a piece
it runs on a saturday and sunday june 20
20th and 21st i believe
i will post a link on twitter
and on slack for a sign up sheet
if you're interested if you've never
soldered before and want to learn how to
solder and then teach
people how to solder we will do a
workshop to teach you how to solder how
to
unsolder and help people troubleshoot
their bat their their solder kits as
well so it's a great opportunity
if you've always wanted to and never
have this this is an option
uh for you to or an opportunity for you
to to get those skills
so follow us if you follow us on twitter
at badgepirates
um or or catch us on slack uh if you're
even kind of just remotely interested
sign up we'll get some communication out
around this um but and we'll we'll kind
of maybe follow up uh
uh what's up guys my name is ryan uh
i'm with dev security um i'm just gonna
quickly kind of recap the ctf that
happened at b-sides
the mud ctf um i'm not actually the best
person to probably be presenting this
but dan is out of town and so
i'm going to be doing it so some quick
facts
the ctf that was at b-sides was a mud
framework which is like a multi-user
dungeon
the whole design and kind of idea was
all a dance thing
it was just kind of a twist on normal
ctfs where instead of doing the jeopardy
thing
you have this like dungeon you crawl
through and you find different
challenges as you're going through
it was a team-based ctf uh the challenge
categories we had were crypto forensics
mobile web
stego phoning reversing programming
and then some miscellaneous ones we
couldn't really categorize
and then there was actually real world
hacking ones where if you went to any of
the villages
around b-sides you could also earn some
flags at the different villages
uh all the in-game challenges were done
by like the depth
kind of crew a bunch of us just
contributed different stuff
so the scoring breakdown so overall
there was actually 50
possible flags uh the total possible
points was
i think that's 2 970
000 i think that's right uh 21 teams
uh scored at least one point um
the top team was trust boundary with
872 000
the most flags they were actually tied
with sexism for the most flags at 18.
uh and of challenges solved
31 of the 50 possible challenges that
were in the game
were actually solved and then that
bottom little chart
is just the teams and how many different
challenges they solved
and on the right side is the all the
scoring breakdown
and by the way at the end it was kind of
a cluster i wasn't actually there
but at the end i guess it was a cluster
and if you were on one of those
top 10 teams and didn't get your prize
bag or something just come talk to me
after
because i think not everyone got their
stuff but just let me know
the flag values uh we can post that
stuff if you wanted i don't know if it
really matters
the top five most solved uh stego one
uh crypto one reversing opponent web two
which i don't know why web one wasn't
more but i guess that's not worked out
uh and i will just quickly kind of show
you guys what these challenges were like
even though it was like a mud uh kind of
dungeon design you still kind of popped
out a lot to
web challenges or crypto challenges or
whatever so challenge one this is the
most solved challenge
was a simple stego level one
this was a file that you found that
would be hosting on a server it was this
little critter i don't know what that is
actually
the best thing to do with these when you
first get one is to check out the exif
data
uh this one was pretty simple because
once you put this into like an exit
viewer
the description of this image was
actually the flag so
pretty basic one quite a few people
solved it
and so next time if you ever play
something to look for
the next one i was going to cover was
sago 2 which there was only two people
that solved
so you came across a note that had this
text on it
which is just it doesn't quite make
sense at all
uh it's kind of an out of order looking
sentence maybe
the hint was it's a nine-sided circle
i don't know if that hits completely
good but it's good enough
definitely once you figure it out um
and so nine sided circle you can kind of
see
just because you know the flag formats
are gonna have those brackets
and it's gonna have flag in there you
can try to try to figure out how you can
make
the word flag with the bracket the
nine-sided circle was a pretty big hint
because if you take
the ninth letter every ninth character
in the string you can see that it starts
to spell out flag
there and so if you loop through this
entire
script or text you can find that you can
actually go with a simple little python
one-liner
just to print off the ninth character
and if you run that you'll get the flag
that
walker nearly bachelor teacher stood but
a little bit tougher and not a lot of
people solved it
um so just something to look for next
time you play
we had 19 challenges in the game that
were never solved
so we'll just save those ones for next
year i guess
that's nice for us we made a bunch of
these challenges
and lastly one of the challenges that
wasn't solved
is actually still posted on our twitter
if you go out there's an image there and
if you look at it something
clearly looks a little off about that
image a little
shot of the kc skyline but if you go to
the twitter page you can download that
image if you solve it
message me on twitter or slack or
something and we've got prizes that we
still left over from
the ctf anyways and if you still want to
solve it send me the flag
it's in there good luck with that
[Applause]
and if you have any issues with the ctf
or questions uh
come to me afterwards dan's out of town
but he would probably have
thanks ryan good job
thanks you did a good job on this etf
thank you all right well
ladies and gentlemen that concludes may
2kc see you next month
it's always on patch tuesday
[Applause]
