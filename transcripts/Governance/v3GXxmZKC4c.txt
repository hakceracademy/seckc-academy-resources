um so happy to be here tonight happy to
be here for ladies night my name is
Melissa Ryan a little bit of background
about myself I will warn you you now
have a compliance person slash Auditor
in your midst is I know that was kind of
scary but I was told you would all be
friendly for the evening so
curiosity anyone else willing to admit
or self-identify any experience
in that area
a few hands I love it friends family
people you might talk to that you don't
absolutely despise in that area
not a lot of hands all right well I'm in
a friendly crowd tonight
so I'm told very technical group
absolutely makes sense
um my presentation is not overlay
technical I'm here to share a little bit
of perspective from my role my various
roles my background and experience
I'm hoping that helps you a bit in your
role and position and please happy to
take questions banter back and forth as
we go
um pretty fluid relaxed seems like
that's the type of crowd so we're good
um my background I spent a little over a
decade in public accounting I know and
making real points here with everyone
but in public accounting working in the
risk advisory compliance audit Social
Security nit related Services
um after that went to a legal processing
service provider here in Kansas City a
global company was responsible for
building their audit Department then
partnered with our security team our
legal team built a compliance team and
put together an integrated governance
and Assurance model That's the basis for
some people I'll share tonight some of
it's from what I've seen at other
clients and organizations as well I've
been wanting to share that so goals are
up here hopefully you take away just a
couple of tidbits of a different
perspective a new way to look at things
um as well as some ideas questions
things you could take tomorrow to either
give your Auditors or compliance folks a
hard time that's always a good thing
right or something you can use
so when we talk about collaborative
governance I'm not going to do a lot of
definitions but did want to level set on
when I speak of governance
um what am I talking about
um so these are some of the
characteristics and structures that we
look for in a standard governance model
um hopefully nothing terribly surprising
here but we do this to grow the business
to secure the business to protect the
data to make sure that things are
operating as they should be
um so that we can make the money
um protect the data
grow personal growth business growth a
lot of good things come from structuring
so here's where we come to the audience
participation part of the evening
um when we talk about collaborative
governance these are some of the teams
that I'm talking about so it's folks in
my role audit compliance risk privacy
folks in the security role of folks in
the legal role I.T management it truly
is collaborative across all of these
functions but certain functions and
roles have additional responsibilities
so first we're gonna have a little fun
with
um stereotypes and some of those first
things you think of when you hear some
of these teams some of these roles in
your organization so the first one I
want to start with
is internal audit
tell me some of the words that come to
meetings yep yep Auditors like meetings
non-compliance non-compliance
they like saying no they like saying no
they make up findings that's a good one
Excel
Excel so
what was that documentation
documentation you guys are good so here
was a list I had a lot of people all of
what you said true and I've heard that
many many years nothing hurts my
feelings anymore
um accountants audit police
um they don't really understand
operations how are they gonna come in
here and like tell me what I'm doing or
check what I'm doing they've never done
it before
um we have no Hammer as I have proven
wrong tonight I do shots honors friendly
people do shots
um we enjoy a good time too
um made up findings gotchas
um you're back again we're having
another meeting and you have another
Excel checklist
um so pretty On Target there for
internal audit right
um
similar but sometimes different tell me
about your compliance CT compliance
similar to audit right
all right
I'll give you some answers on this one
but you're gonna have to participate in
the next one
um very similar
um
been referred to as the business
prevention department that's always fun
um they're control freaks they have
checklists they come in with these crazy
lists and Frameworks and who wants to
pay attention to that
you put the new in Innovation they put
the known animation that's nice very
nice all right so now how about
okay
come on I can throw them out but you
know
Department of no I actually don't have
that on my list I'm gonna have to add
that
[Music]
yeah we are not happy until you're not
happy
what a slow hit I want to come work with
you
nerds
techniques
me and you guys were all over internal
um so
this is what we say about you behind
your backs okay she didn't know
um anti-social and flexible
yeah they always speak fun oh they're
I.T people it's a favorite right I know
um and they do stuff don't don't worry
about don't worry about me I'm doing
stuff I'm good right
um so just play you know a little fun
with the different stereotypes but these
are our teams right these are the folks
back to the the original pieces that we
talked about and we're truly aligned
with some common goals if you step back
from I'm doing my piece you're doing
your piece
um when we think about what we're trying
to do for the business there are
definitely some common goals we're
aligned in certain ways
ideally we're working together
collaboratively
um to move the ball down the court in
the same direction
so
security takes a certain strategy around
securing the data protecting the assets
whether the company assets client data
our employees physically and the
information we're keeping about them
right so
they strategize around how to protect
how to prevent anything getting out how
to make sure the right people have the
access
um your audit your compliance teams are
similarly engaged in the same goal
they're wanting to come in and help in
many ways check Monitor and report that
hopefully you all are doing what you
need to be doing and everyone wants that
good report going up or on the flip side
we're going to do some of this a little
bit later on like ideas and things to
take back in questions
if there's gaps that you know of and are
having problems getting the funding
resources attention
leverage those teams as part of those
assessments and getting the attention
that you need so there's common goals if
you approach it in that way
again growing the business aligning for
New Growth new markets new products
whatever that might be
so even though we have the stereotypes
we just did each other we have a lot of
fun doing that hopefully and sometimes
there is you know there's tension in
that right hopefully healthy sometimes
more than
um but ideally aligned by Common goals
so as we were building an integrated
model across security risk compliance
privacy for a global organization we
spent some time talking with different
companies different professional
organizations around our companies doing
this how are they structuring it who's
responsible for what who's involved and
the one thing we came away with is there
is no one right way to do it
found some wrong ways I'm sure you all
have experienced some challenges in your
organization around working together
different structures things that just
way to do it a question that we kept
coming back to and I think it's just a
good discussion Point
um to continue and we still do is it the
chicken in a question does security
drive or does compliance Drive who's
strategizing around how we're doing some
of those common goals that we're aligned
with
you can take back to your companies your
organizations your teams
and begin to think who is driving in my
organization how do I leverage that or
change that depending on your
perspective of whether it's working
right
um but who and what drives the security
strategy and how you're approaching that
from a process a technology and
implementation perspective
um who's leading that charge who is
reporting to Executives who's reporting
to the board who's identifying those
problems and Reporting them up and
getting things prioritized and how do
you get into that chain how do you get
into that Communication channel how do
you get into that budgeting process
because everything comes down to the
resources right
and what type of reporting is in place
and how can you leverage that is that
your compliance team is that your audit
team
if your auditor compliance team hasn't
come to visit you as a security function
recently
I can get them focused for where they
need to be in many ways
um sometimes there are components that
come down from a compliance standpoint
when um regulations change so there may
be drivers coming into your organization
and your team from from many different
places from compliance from your clients
new products new markets and changes
business growth technology changes but
thinking about where do different
components come from where does the
information flow and how do you get into
that channel and feed to get
accomplished what you need to get
accomplished and no needs to get
foreign
so this is a comment that's been um
shared by Holly
um as a audit and compliance person I'm
reminded often if we get the security
right the compliance pieces will just
fall you can get your Excel spreadsheet
you can go document and we'll be set
so I'm curious as to this group's
[Music]
good plan somebody raise your hand and
I'll come bring the mic to you thank you
Julie
I heard it coming over here good plan
any opposing horses
or common you raised your hand at the
same time I asked well I hope nobody uh
beats me up after saying this but I
would think that maybe compliance Drive
security because the different
compliance requirements out there
regulations and
and other organizations so you have to
build your security around the
compliance
Drive higher prioritize
I think security aimed or I'm sorry I
think the compliance aims at security
but it's slow and reactive it doesn't
stay current with it its goal is to get
you in security but they're overlapping
Fair good visual
yes
other thoughts perspectives
[Music]
this group is wall-to-wall opinions you
yeah
I I honestly think that it depends on
how Proactive or reactive your security
team is or what's been required up if
you wanted to come into play it's a push
and pull I've been on both sides it's a
chicken and an egg conundrum
oh
eats the egg
what
uh compliance can also imply a Finish
Line in where we press the Finish Line
we're compliant we're done and security
um
[Music]
all right so I appreciate those
perspectives I think that gives a good
example of it could go either way it's
circumstantial we love and it depends
answer right
um I really like the the last comment
around security is fluid compliance also
needs to be fluid and keep up but
sometimes those functions and this is
organization dependent as well move at
different speeds different Paces might
be required to because of the roles
functions and different challenges that
[Music]
um if those two teams are working
towards the same thing in the same
direction collaborating on the
requirements from a compliance
perspective because if we have
Regulatory Compliance requirements it's
not an option we do have to follow those
and align security with them
however that may not address everything
that needs to be addressed for the
organization that compliance requirement
is only for a certain scope certain
component of the business certain type
of data there's probably multiple
security components across a different
compliance Frameworks that apply but
it's never going to be a
one-size-fits-all so I tend to lead
towards the security driving in this
case but you need to pull in both of the
components to get that to be right the
scope has to be right so this is the
I'll answer the second question on here
for you it needs to consider all the
right aspects and Dynamics can't be
focused on just one component of
security the technical aspects can't be
focused it needs to consider the people
the process everything up through
background checks and getting the right
folks in to manage the pieces so it's
truly an end-to-end piece and if
security is brought together in that
vein and with that perspective it truly
does get the organization a long way
towards your compliance your right
resume management your audit
requirements and answer some of those
questions
so one more
compliance Frameworks are the language
in which business interprets and
communicates security
true false
and he knows we're all in agreement I'm
so in many cases we have seen that
not everyone fully understands the ins
and outs of security and all of the
detailed requirements the technical
components the processes the operations
the monitoring
um the rest everything that goes into
that the compliance Frameworks what they
do have in value is providing that
translation layer if you will in many
cases translating into common
terminology standard set of expectations
that allow companies to compare against
competitors other entities to prove to
Regulators because again many cases we
are required to do the things that we're
doing right to prove that we are
evidence that so there is value in
having those Frameworks but it's
striking the balance between where do we
use them how do we leverage them where
so when we talk about collaboration
points across these teams
um together is better simply The Motto
um
knowing your business and leveraging
those teams to help identify changes
track information
um a lot of times I've talked with
security teams or other teams in the
organization who feel they aren't
necessarily informed as to what's
happening in the business what's
changing where are we going what's our
Direction you're bringing on new systems
you're making changes to systems you're
bringing on new assets that I don't know
they exist
new locations I didn't know when we're
opening and
so not being in that information flow is
often a challenge and you can't do the
job you're hard to do the things you
need to do to go back to secure and
protect
so leverage those other teams those
other other governance teams for the
information the updates the trigger
points that cause you to reassess change
strategy modify approach
um and back and forth the information
sharing is truly a key point in the
collaboration
the Assets in scoping also an
interesting point and this is definitely
an area where I would recommend you work
iteratively and collaboratively with
your audit your compliance teams as
Security Professionals identifying where
are the riskiest points what are the two
assets we're trying to protect where are
they sitting what's the status right now
of the security structure around them
where are our risk points
um oftentimes you know those insights
better than better than the other teams
it comes back to the information sharing
making sure folks are focused on the
right areas and not on something that
did happen to come up on a checklist or
a compliance framework make sure that
we're in agreement on where the value is
what the important assets are and where
the risk points are and where we need to
be focusing our collaborative efforts
on The Leverage points I think I
mentioned a little bit earlier on
coordinated reporting
your auditor comes in hopefully they're
not making up all of the findings that
they've found and some of them are
actually legit and real and true things
that need to be fixed in the
organization
um make sure they're getting it right
obviously
um but then get on board with getting
those fixed
um I've been in board level reporting
before where we've collaborated
collaboratively organized with the CIO
all agreed on the issues
and presented it as the perfect
opportunity
for this executive to say I need the
resources I need new tools here's what I
need to address these true risk of the
organization we presented in that
fashion and he says I'm good
this was your opportunity to say yeah
you're right this is a problem I need
that here's how I fix it and here's what
I mean
so going to coordinated collaborative
communicate up front make sure
everyone's in the No No Surprises
um but just an example of where that
so one really real life example
one year has heard of gdpr
few hands awesome love it so this is an
EU based regulation that becomes
effective in May of 2018. and if your
organization stores processes handles
any data for EU citizens
any of their personally identifiable
information and your organization has
not started doing something to comply
with this regulation you are way behind
um it it is a regulation that even
though it's based in the EU it applies
globally because it is to EU citizen
personal data wherever it lives
including here in the middle of the U.S
um so just some Basics on there just for
a little bit of background for those who
are not necessarily familiar with this
um
it's kind of a perfect storm there's
components of it that address data
security there's components of it that
address typical privacy considerations
notice consent and there's pieces of it
that require governance and Regulatory
oversight at a level that many have
never seen
question
Corrections
the question is how will this impact the
UK If brexit proceeds
um it will just like it impacts us here
we're not part of the EU but the UK and
each of the E the EU member countries
has their own data protection
regulations this regulation is new to
harmonize and unify those are great
words coming from Regulators right
but it applies the same concept so even
if brexit proceeds
is still obligated to protect EU citizen
if you have clients in the UK they would
no longer be EU citizens
assuming brexit proceeds and all of that
completes however there are UK
requirements as well yes
so this is current awesome great example
for we're in the collaboration elements
come together just some examples of the
different considerations across some of
these governance teams that we've talked
about hopefully visualization having a
highlighting for you the need for these
teams to collaborate communicate
coordinate on these aspects
um so I'm going to start actually on the
right side of the slide with the
governance piece the cross team
coordination definitely key
um they're going to pull in legal
they're going to pull the business
process we're going to pull nit we're
going to pull in HR everyone across the
board so
on an HR note
companies here with
EU citizens as Associates where maybe
your HR Master System is sitting here in
the U.S absolutely have to address this
as well so some unique considerations
not just client information or service
related information your internal
associates also
so the global nature and the
cross-border considerations is the extra
territoriality component of the
regulation one of my absolute favorite
words by the way it's like
supercalifragilistics for maybe
compliance herbs but
um but that is truly the application of
the regulation across the club
um oversight reporting
there will be multiple I think the last
estimate I heard was you know 30 000 new
Regulators coming on in the EU to go
monitor against what companies are doing
to comply with this law so definitely
something they are expecting to actually
be regulated audited and checked
um and a new regulation for
organizations to have a data Protection
very consistent with what your privacy
teams have been considering and
addressing all along some of the unique
components the right to be forgotten if
I as an EU citizen if you have my
information and I request that you
remove
any record that I ever existed in your
systems you have to do that and based on
the regulation so this poses some really
interesting questions for banking audit
logging security logging you have to
know where the information is first to
go delete it but then once you delete it
what did that do to the Integrity of
your information what did that do to
your ability to research Trace potential
fraud cases a lot of different
considerations there so some challenges
organizations are working through
evidence and compliance
vendor oversight a lot of different
integral aspects that extend well beyond
that you must Implement appropriate
organizational and Technical measures of
your choosing of course but those are
what will be audited what needs to be
approved for compliance that they are
liberally securing and protecting that
information and security by Design
definitely a requirement as part of the
regulation one of the new challenges in
the ray that's been causing a lot of
discussion is the breach notification
requirement
excuse me so you are required to notify
the individuals and The Regulators
within 72 hours of when you become aware
of the breach so that's pretty stringent
and comes with some Hefty fines for
non-compliance
access components mapping security
considerations
so different different components in
each column
um but a lot of different aspects the
cross considerations need to be
coordinated must work together so this
is just one item that's out there right
now requiring us to continue to
collaborate move forward
wrapping up just a little bit just
through question we may build a wall
does that stop kdbr when they build the
I knew I liked this group I really did
um so you know in closing happy to
answer some questions
um one of the kind of the teasers in the
intro was just there's a few tidbits um
to take away
um questions or ideas to ask or think
about back at the office tomorrow on the
collaborative aspect get together talk
the Auditors the compliance teams they
might do shots with you take them out
you know get together a grand scope a
grand terminology definitions get on the
same page as to what you're talking
about where you're moving the direction
you're going
um it's not a gotcha game
your Auditors are playing the gotcha
game need to set them straight
absolutely
um compliance coming with all of those
Frameworks really push them to leverage
a shared assessments approach and we
found Great Value and success and
efficiency in this and we don't need to
test things multiple times don't need to
bug everyone multiple times there's ways
to Leverage The Common components
um similar commentary for the evidence
requests if you're audit compliance
folks are coming asking for things
multiple times challenge them as to why
they need it multiple times what are
they doing with it what's the scope what
is it addressing
um definitely ask questions and
challenge
um
on the closing piece just recommending
that in that collaborative piece going
towards the reporting and the why
focusing on the security the business
growth those common objectives and
Alignment is really the goal here in
that teamwork and working together
with that I'm happy to answer any
questions hear comments
um but that is what I have to share
