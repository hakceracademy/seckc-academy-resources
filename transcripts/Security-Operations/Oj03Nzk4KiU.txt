these guys from sec dsm who are going to
explain to us now
why i left a ten thousand dollar
computer running for seven straight days
and all it got was one sec kc coin
all right let's start off with the
misnomer
bill said this was hacking
setcoin and that is not correct what we
did was idiotic and stupid and not
financially responsible at all but it
was 100 legitimate and what you see on
my forehead trent did this and
the whole defcon parties group is
awesome so let's give it another round
sorry
so i'm going to give this i'm going to
give this to tom
tommy's going to start us off with sec
dsm we make things difficult
hello
so
uh i don't know first introductions
because you guys might not know who we
are well this is this is ryan here ryan
heckman and brent murphy and i'm tom
holt um we're we came down from des
moines we've been coming down here for a
little while now but uh we heard that
you guys were making some some crypto
coin and we thought wow
oh wait before we get started everyone
do this right now so we've got
i'm sorry
now for those of you with defcon you
might and you went to a talk you might
have noticed that i didn't get to do
this at all
so it is my pleasure to say that we have
a tradition here at set kc that is not
going to go away
if this is your first time speaking in
set kc you have to take a shot so
gentlemen
here's to our speakers and here's to you
guys the crowd
[Applause]
all right so
where are we so before we get started
you want to do this right now go follow
dsm on twitter and then tweet i heart
section and if you're if you're in slack
or or you're not it's like go sign up
for slack right away do it now do it now
and then if your uh slack handle is
different than your
twitter id go ahead and make sure you
know what that is we'll talk about that
later
it's complicated but it's not going to
be complicated for everybody just wait
so do that do it now go follow sexysm on
twitter and then tweet that you love us
or not tweet that you hate us
uh so by the way we want to start and
say we love set kc and we're sorry i'm
not sorry
about what we what we've done the evil
things that we've been doing
uh
so to get uh
when we started this we started this
about a month ago actually it was
exactly a month ago is the second
tuesday of july
we were sitting here and they're talking
a little bit more about setcoin we're
like well what is this thing let's
figure it out we have no idea when we
started what cryptocurrency is all about
none at all like like we heard there's
like a wallet or something and you do
mining or something we had no idea but
we went to the
setcoin
github thing or the wiki the wiki thing
and we learned everything that we needed
to do
but what we wanted to do is we
definitely wanted to mess with sequoia
all right now
um
how we wanted to do that was we wanted
to we wanted to find as much point as we
could so we heard that there's you know
he wants to give out about uh
1337 coin per day total right so of
everyone that's mining you know it's
going to give out about 1300 uh and 37
coin in it in a day so that's its target
and we wanted to do better
we we wanted to do better than that so
so basically we started
by uh by cpu mining
there is this better yes all right
so we started by cpu mining because we
didn't know any better so we we uh
turned on
what's that oh you want to talk about
that
all right so cpu mining so i had like 10
cloud of cost instances who here is a
cloud cost customer right yeah those
guys are awesome one time for a live fee
so while i'm sitting in this corner i'm
firing up 10 cloud of cost instances to
do cpu mining and i'll tell you a cloud
of costs they kind of suck
they don't mind very much but when you
have 10 of them it's like 40 000 hashes
this is like equivalent to what uh what
a really shitty gpu will do
really shitty like a 10 year old gpu
will do but it was free so why the hell
not so we did cpu mining and i'll hand
it off to the guys that did
that progressed to the next step
all right so we're going to talk about
gpu money for a second gpu mining on
personal hardware so literally the day
after i get back from the last month's
set kc meeting i got my gtx 1080 golden
like founders edition hardware and it
was freaking b to the a and bill has a
question did you guys say where you guys
were from we are from canada we're not
from kansas city or canada we're from
and the funny thing is the thursday
after this meeting every month is our
meeting so like this is this is a two
times a week thing once a month for us
so this is awesome we love it down here
we love everybody here and we love
everything this is about and we're
trying to emulate it up north
and uh
we're working on it it's gonna be us a
yeah there's something to say a like
we're from canada
so i get my gtx 1080 in the mail i'm
like oh man i'm going to decimate these
guys i must do i'm going to do some gpu
mining not the case
the new the new hardware is based on
pascal architecture which
none of the miners are optimized for so
i actually threw in my old two-year-old
r9 290 which was way better
and i was getting about
900 kilohashes which was still freaking
awesome compared to what the network
hash rate at the time was and then uh
we'll pass it off to tom here need to
talk about our next step in domination
so our next episode at that sport so
when we started well i got another slide
on this good i put this together on the
way down so i apologize if it doesn't
it's actually a mystery van oh by the
way
we noticed that somebody had a vinyl
printer over there for his printing
stuff for vinyl on cars and and uh
no it's not gonna happen i i know what
you guys are planning on doing you're
never going to find that van all right
just say it
it's back to the airport whatever it's
just gone don't worry about it
all right
gpu mining so
oh sorry mining mining on aws what that
shot is really going in my head i don't
know right and so
so after we did some some mining on
local gpus we're like how do we get more
right like i don't want to go mail order
these things apparently on amazon amazon
web services uh and i apologize if you
keep hearing every like 12 seconds
you'll hear my laptop
we're mining right now actively and you
know how he said that he gets a coin
every well he got one point in the week
right now we're at about 12 seconds
we're getting a new coin right now so
anyways just just keep listening it's a
really exciting experience but okay so
back to so we wanted to do more so we
found amazon has a couple of options for
uh gpu instances each one could do how
many was it 256 gpu each gpu could on
amazon can do
256 kilohashes per second one of the
boxes would do and one of the boxes had
four of those cards in it and so you
could do about a mega hash with one of
the big boxes or you could do four small
boxes to get to that same mega hatch
and and one thing we learned was that
they charge like i don't know two bucks
or two and a quarter an hour for that up
to 26 dollars an hour up to 26 an hour
how are we going to go to ireland unless
you're going to ireland and well maybe
we might have done that so but one thing
we learned is that they amazon has this
thing where
if nobody's using gpu miners
you could request what's called a spot
instance so instead of paying two bucks
an hour for a machine you can pay nine
[Music]
the cost gets down to that it'll spin up
however many instances you said you want
for as long as the price stays under
your max bid so and they have gpu miners
in at least with six regions around the
world ireland has a whole bunch that
nobody ever uses
well it got used for for a little while
but we found you know even at nine cents
an hour that can get kind of expensive
for mega hash right so then after that
we switched to
we found these things called asic miner
oh oh sorry one more one more talk about
gpu so so gpu like every
miner
is optimized for some sort of
architecture and so there's there's
cudaminer that's that's that's optimized
for cuda based video or gpu cards um so
obviously if you're if you're going to
use any other miners against the gpu
card
test it against gpu miner because if if
you use one that's optimized for
whatever platform you're mining with
you're going to get a better hash rate
and so we we tested
i don't know how many and they're all
forks of the same miner that are
optimized for different things so i mean
test play around you're gonna get better
rates until you you're like okay i'm
happy with this so we ended up with uh
with cudaminer mining gpus
that's right that's right and then yeah
so nvidia versus ati my understanding we
didn't ever play with any ati stuff but
we hear ati video cards gpu cards can
actually hash faster than the nvidia
stuff we only had in video aws only has
nvidia uh so use that as you will so if
you've got an account
oh yeah so also on spot instances so one
of the things that
we wanted to do to automate this is we
we created our own virtual machine that
when it turns on it automatically kicks
on both cpu mining and gpu mining at the
same time and then hashes back to our
own wallets our own wallet server and we
can we'll talk a little bit more about
that in just a few slides about you know
how how we how we were doing that
uh but then
asic mining so we discovered that hey
you know they make these uh they make
these custom boxes that you can plug
into a raspberry pi or anything else and
you can you know and we found the zeus
boxes on amazon for i don't know
so the story about 260 dollar asic
miners so this guy will do 20 28 to 32
mega hashes per second and it was
originally listed for 360 dollars and i
was like so i amazon message this guy
and i was like hey i'm just getting into
mining there's this small cryptocurrency
that i wanted to get involved with but
this is outside my price range so can
you bring it down a little bit he goes
absolutely this is the best binder for
entry level i'll bump it down to 260 for
you right so this guy ships it out cut
deal right like 260 bucks it's a really
good deal on this miner
but the shitty part is he's like power
supply included i was like great this
thing sucked up 1200 watts per hour 1200
watt power supply right so he ships it
to me but the shitty part is is
the power supply was clearly not meant
for this miner so i'm out of deathcon
when it arrives my wife receives it i'm
like you gotta plug this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in for me
right
she has no clue what she's doing
so
she sends me a picture and it's in like
four parts there's a power supply
like a chassis and a top part of the
chassis and then my raspberry pi which
i'd already pre-configured for her to
hook up
and so she gets it
and the power supply doesn't fit
like there are too many cables so it's
clear that this seller
stripped out the good power supply put
in one that he got for fifty dollars
that just doesn't even fit into the damn
thing and so we just place it on top of
it run the cables right through the vent
hole for the power supply and keep on
rocking right so i i come home after
defcon i open up my the door to the
basement and i'm like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is there
a couple fans running down here i'm like
50 feet away from it and it's loud as
hell like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you not it is loud as
hell
and but nothing rocks
i'm going to reiterate what i said from
the start
everything that we've done is fiscally
irresponsible
it is not equate dollar to dollar from
whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're doing to
setpoint all right this is for the lulls
we're just having fun
don't buy one of those all right so so
back to so yeah so we we're now into
this for you know nine cents an hour
plus 265 dollars plus
you know i think overall we've spent
well let's see we at this point probably
about 300 350 maybe 400 easy
on what we've done and then we bought
this no no no that includes this thing
this is the component of it and then and
then we decided
wow
you can buy this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] by the hour online
[Music]
and so this this guy in the blue shirt
sitting over here by the laptop it's not
his his name's nate he's uh we're
sitting here more like oh you can you
can ebay hash rates what that's the word
bidding on ebay and he's like no no no
no there's this badass site you can go
to called
mining rig rentals.com and he's beaten
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of our ebay hashing
and it was ridiculous
all right so now we discover that we can
uh
we can we can buy this thing by the by
the giga hash per hour
for three hours right so we we run this
thing up so when we get started a month
ago the entire network hashrate was 300
kilohashes per second right which is the
equivalent of just a little bit more
than what one small gpu instance on
amazon could do right and the difficulty
was 0.002
i think like when the network force gets
going it's like 0.0002
and then as more people start hashing
the harder it gets so we thought what if
so our we have we have
our attack on the coin is basically this
step one we wait for low difficulty so
when we started the difficulty was
really low like that 0.02 i was talking
about and then and then basically
um we decided you know if we look at the
network hash rate we saw oh it's three
three hundred kill hashes per second so
we mine the everloving [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of sec
kc coin so we just spin up enough
instances to really make that difficulty
like 10 or 100 or right now we may
maybe a little higher we'll get yeah a
little bit higher and then and then what
we do is after the difficulty gets so we
jumped immediately from 0.002
to 0.8
in one day something like 10 000 sec kc
point right 10 000. not 1000
10 000 in one day and then all of a
sudden the difficulty went up to that
0.8 we're like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this
difficulty thing because we don't we
didn't understand difficulty and we
realized oh these things stair step up
so we apparently blew through the entire
blockchain and like about from my
calculations correctly if i'm wrong it
looks like it reevaluates the difficulty
about every 3 500 coin so 3 500 coin it
reevaluates and says well these guys
have been mining really fast so i'm
going to jump the difficulty so that the
next set of 3 500 blocks
is at this higher rate and so we decided
well we will uh we will wait
so once once the once the difficulty
goes up we'll shut all our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down
wait for the difficulty to go back down
and then and then we'll start mining the
overload we should have it again so
right here you'll see in the graph where
we started and we jumped up to that that
uh that point eight and then and then we
mined it that's that one day between the
two red arrows and then we waited and
then it took like a week and a half
before the it went from 0.8 back down to
that like zero i think we went back down
to like 0.03 and we're like guys guys
guys turn it all back on let's go go go
and we got another like 15 000 and
we're really sorry sorry i'm sorry
and and so and so and then so then we
jumped it up again and you see so
looking at the graph here i don't know
if i can do the laser point or anything
yeah there it goes so right here was
where we were playing with it before and
that's where it went back down like
right there that's where it went back
down and then we're like well let's
really crank the difficulty damn it all
right buttons buttons
so then up here
man i just don't know how it worked so
then we decided to make things really
difficult and this is what we started
outsourcing so like some of this was
like still gpu mining with amazon and
then we decided to buy
and then with the the difficulty went
exponentially up to 20. so not like
point anything not one not two but 20.
so
and then hilarity ensues because we're
like you know i posted in the slack
channel i'm like uh hey looks like
somebody like it's like 1.5
mega hatches right now wasn't it like
300 kilo hashes and circles like
and uh you can't read in the screenshot
there but yeah i have a screenshot of
what bill posted whereas 12
yeah 13 13 uh mega hashes is at this
point zero six difficulty point zero six
difficult yeah this is when it was still
relatively easy
right so then we made things really hard
and we became hashing addicts so one of
the things that we discovered is that we
were doing things independently and
mining to our own wallets and we didn't
we couldn't see what each other was
doing like i couldn't tell when this
this joker spun up you know six mega
hatches and that one spun up 30 mega
hashes or that guy over there
so we decided we needed to figure out
what we're doing as compared to everyone
else so we created what's called a
cooler and that in that cooler uh we can
see like what each other of us is doing
so collectively we're basically mining
our stuff against everybody else in the
network so we can so you know one of the
concerns we had is we're like we're over
spending right so you know if they're
hashing at 300 kilohashes per second we
probably could just get away with
you know 600 kilohashes per second or or
maybe if we want 90 of the coin we can
go to like you know a couple mega
hatches per second he said we're
overspending but we're also stupid the
air is thinner up north and it's way
colder
indeed so
so then uh supra over here as we uh as
we got really became addicted to this
we're like how far can we go and that's
when we got it all the way up to 5.5
gigahertz not killer hashes not mega
hashes but giga hashes right
so and i told you where we were well
what we got up to
or where we started and where we got up
to now with the state of today like
today we got here and we're like
we were at when we walked in the door
we were at
127 mega hashes so there's another
gentleman in the back uh who yeah right
actually he's right here
he's got he's made it difficult so we
were at 127 mega hashes
and as of right now
uh 14 gig hashes
14 giga hashes so that's 12 million
kilohashes per second remember we
started at 300 kilohashes per second
we're now at 12
oh yeah by the way we made some friends
while we were at def con and actually is
that b-sides one guy told me i've got a
peta hatcher that's sitting idle in
florida right now so
it may could might start up in a little
bit anyways the current difficulty is
now sitting at 19.82
19.82 and so here after we're done today
we mined the ever-loving [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of all
of the coin if we turn this off it's
probably going to take about a month
before the difficulty gets back down to
so you know people with a backup of the
pro that goes away for death time for a
week will get any coin
now let's talk about that for a second
so you start off at a real easy hatching
rate the penalty to one
skc makes a ton of sense you ramp that
up and obviously the value goes up
because you're spending way more money
per kilowatt hour no matter how you're
hashing this to make one skc and this
this was the case with bitcoin you get
you get it real early you make a lot of
money and it drops off
we're not doing this for financial gain
we're not going to screw everybody over
for the until the end of the time you
know this this is for the walls and it's
all for a good time so
um don't be discouraged to go start
mining skc just because of the hash
rates you see on the screen you don't
have to
like i said it's not it's not fiscally
responsible to do what we're doing and
and as far as i'm concerned i'm done now
that we've done this
so i've spent hundreds of dollars
and i think we all have a piece so don't
be don't be discouraged bill you're
and the cool thing with that is
you get a percent
even if you don't
discover you know you know that block or
whatever you get a percentage based on
how much you mind to that pool
of
of the payouts
so that's pretty cool i'm like i'm i
discovered nothing for days on end
because the guy in the blue shirt over
there was mine that they ever love and
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of it but i had mine long
enough that i was getting something out
of it so
we will post it on seconddsm.org if you
guys want to mine to the pool that's
totally cool we're totally cool with
posting on sec casey it's all fun you
know we're just we're just having fun
oh yeah by the way uh if anybody has a
really good question your name is not
bill
i have a
limited edition sec dsm paper wallet
right here with a private key loaded
with
500
kc coin right here so that means you
could take this wallet right now walk
yourself over to the swag booth and get
yourself some swag like
how awesome is that so when people come
out with some good questions here
tonight this is yours so question right
here what percentage of the economy do
you now control
percentage
so the question is how much how much
so we currently control
69
of uh set casey
tonight through the end of tonight yeah
yeah all right i got first to comment
because i [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] quit because you guys
we're sorry sorry
all right well well here okay so sir i
coin
you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it everybody look
under your seat
there's a paper wallet underneath almost
every seat in the house
with 501 set kc coin on it all right
pull it out right now not every scene i
apologize we didn't make billions it's
25 000. we had 25 000 that we threw at
this so it's all under your seat we just
taped up a little envelope uh there's at
least two or three per table
like even along the bar side here you
might have a wallet
so here's the here's the thing you have
to use this coin tonight tonight so
right now or sometime tonight before
they close up you gotta go over and get
swag that's enough swag for a sec kc
velcro patch or whatever it is they're
willing to sell you for 500 kc coins we
put 501 on there so we can cover any
kind of transaction fees so you got more
than enough that you can go over there
and and and dos the uh the the uh
the the swag the swag table so now so
now the public
owns
sixty percent
of sec kc controlling shares come on
guys you guys own it
it's all you guys
so the reason why you have to use this
point tonight and tonight only is
because we made those paper wallets we
have all the private keys you have a
private key in your hand but we have the
private key too so if you don't use that
coin tonight we're going to take it back
so i want you all to go over there right
now and wipe out the swag from mr
swearing
big and you can combine stuff together
they got i think for 60 bucks 60 000
points or six thousand six thousand of
that you can get yourself a hoodie so
you and you
20 000 you get a t-shirt to start to
start working with your friends and you
know if they're at it if they get run
out of patches go together and get a
t-shirt
oh yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah yeah so i i apologize so we
actually even had more so we only had
time because we did this all before
defcon do we only have time to make 50
or enough point at that time to make 50
wallets so i apologize if you didn't get
a paper wall under your seat go look at
the seats around you that are empty they
probably have one too
and so
we have a bunch more coin to give away
so anybody that's following sexism on
twitter and give us your slack handle we
will go give you 500 one point right now
that you can go go now and then you can
yeah we'll give it to you in slack and
then you can take that over i know
tonight only so
yeah
the question i have was i never noticed
on the bottom of that chair there's the
coin for the lawn paper wallet right
there
uh the question was i never really saw
an increase on the network so like on
the uh on the
wallet um
app it it shows you how many people are
on the network i never saw that go to
like a stupid number it was always like
five six seven i never saw a theory so
here's here
so the question is like hey i didn't see
a bunch of people connecting in on the
network and this is kind of the secret
to our cooler like at first they were
trying to figure out who was finding who
is mining the bitcoin and so uh since we
hit it all behind one ip address we're
all mining to that guy and that guy was
the one guy talking back to the pool so
so you never tracked anything back to us
you just tracked it back to the pool and
we may have done things like if you find
our cooler because our pooler is out
there and when you're mining you can see
everyone else is who all the ips are
running so i may or may not have found
the the tip bot and if other people were
looking for ours and you show up without
the right name you might get a website
dedicated to bill swearingen not saying
it did i'm just saying it's possible
so anyway go find go go go research go
find some stuff
but yeah tweet us now oh question
so it's an arms race right so any time
that you raise that hash rate up
you know if everybody stays at the hash
rate it's going to keep going up in
difficulty so our attack is basically we
mind tilt it's really stupid difficult
and then we turn all of our stuff off we
just got too addicted and like how big
can we make this high score go and
bill's like hey you guys want to come
talk about it and so we kind of ditched
our like wait for it to go down we did
that a couple times where we got the
hash rate up and then we waited for it
to drop and then we we ramped it back up
again so at this point after tonight
we're going to turn it off
so there are some really well-known
vulnerabilities within
cryptocurrency like the 51 attack and
double spending attacks so these are
attacks against the blockchain itself in
which you don't necessarily have to have
a lot of cpu resources well
the 51 attack you absolutely have to
have more than 51 percent of the total
mining capacity but these are attacks in
which you can
you can say
that you spend some money wait for it to
be confirmed and then spend that money
again so there are double spending
attacks and every one of you i will
recommend go look at double spending
attacks go look at 51 attacks and hack
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at a sec kc coin because that's
what we were trying to do we just didn't
have enough time with defcon so
absolutely go look at those those
blockchain attacks and exploit the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
out of them because security c coin is
primed for those attacks not many people
are mine in it we're going to back off
tonight have added
i'm going to thrice say this was
fiscally irresponsible oh yeah
go back to that last slide
where where people are trying to freak
out and they're like who turns on some
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
this is what it was about from our
perspective we threw hundreds of dollars
at this for zero game we've given it to
you guys it was for fun
but this is what it was about and
hopefully this is what the spirit
of what we do you know between groups is
about it's about fun it's about learning
it's about you know
from my perspective i knew nothing about
cryptocurrency mining
until that night brandon brandon is
sitting right there spinning up
instances trying to figure this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out
and the next day i'm like well i got
this new card i'm gonna try it too and i
knew nothing
this
this uh this guy right here had been
mining it for a month and hadn't said
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so he's a sandbagger
he hasn't said nothing
so i blame everything on him
and i'm gonna give him the money
so
are there any other questions
uh
and i oh by the way i also wanted to
pimp out dsm because you know that's
what it's all about so
so we thought actually we thought it'd
