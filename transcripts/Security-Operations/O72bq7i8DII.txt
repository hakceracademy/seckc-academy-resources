so this just a um a little talk on
creating a USB toolit so uh first I just
want to give you a little intro about me
so I'm a senior the South High School um
21st century program there called case
um sof kind of switch from programming
to more of a security Focus as a friend
and I um decided that we would kind of
want to go down that
path
So So currently an intern for Joel over
there as a security analyst for the
my ruin this kid life
so
I Network just to play around it
servers machines and other things just
around because my parents said I can do
it on theirs um so Med framework um I
love learning was possible that's why I
hey trust me I'm a
lawyer
so this is this is your first time
speaking yes you still have to take a
show yes you do yes you do if you're a
school administrator put your head
down it's not going to take away the
scholarship
right that like champ somebody post that
time so anyway I love to learn that's I
like
Psy a lot of different
possibilities that I'm obviously can't
even
talk
M like two years of experience so it's
nice to know that um so now on now what
we're doing so so um what we're building
is just is just a tool bit so we need
obviously is a flash drive signs depends
on what you want to do um you is a
wonderful multi USB Creator um and I'll
explain all these a little bit more
later um there's EAS for master uh any
live Lin distribution you want uh live
Lin distributions usually
are
um well any and just there's nothing
persistent about it unless you get one
that is
assistance um true GP manager and um
what use these should look like or what
use these I should choose um obviously
purpose like I said you want something
inous like on Drive um flash is pretty
cheap um there's Micro Center you can
buy one for 32 gig $1 and 32 gig and
pretty nice uh Yi uh it's so it's a
multi USB flash mulle operating systems
and dising diagnostic tools and more um
just a little bit about it there's some
of the popular more popular live dist so
open Su Cali Tales Zilla D um it also
allows for unlisted ISO so you can make
your own uh you can make your own live
distributions if you want or just modify
already existing
ones um the find distribution you want
so there's uh just the examples band for
destroying information tails is an o t
um Clonezilla is for miroring discs and
I like to use disc for watch that um
they have a lot of updated information
and um as well as BR in depth specs and
Google is obviously a best friend you
can find uh what you want
there um so we're creating in here we're
creating three partitions a visible
partition that you can U by the way this
is all for um pest or not P well
fantasting with Windows for the most
part um so the way Windows works is it
reads the first primary partition when
you're um in it and uh so we're creating
anyway we're creating three partitions
the visible one that's that you're going
to be visible in in uh in your regular
offering um then there's also an
encrypted that we're going to use TR for
and then there's the multi so um this is
also event so you can um walk through is
on YouTube when they post it
up so what you first want to do is you
want to wipe out whatever you have there
on your regular USB drive uh obviously
everything's going to be wiped off so
keep backups select the right drive and
ter so as it out you want to create your
first this is going to be visible and
order does matter so you want to create
it in order um one thing that I mention
you want to plan out how much space your
diss are going to take up because
everything is kind of based on that um
so you're creating your first primary
partition uh you can do whatever file
you want remember 532 there's a 4 c um
and space make sure it's um next will be
the encrypted
just create as a logical you know
however much you want um and be generous
you never know what you're going to find
um the last is going to be your Yi uh
partition you you're going to want to
create as a primary um and you can use
all the left all what's left of the anal
space uh this is what should look like
uh what you want to do actually is you
want to also convert the verse back to
logical uh the reason for that is when
you
are creating the partitions when you set
the first one up as logical it creates
like a 7 MB an alocated space at the
beginning and that was kind of annoying
to me so I put into primary then
switched it back to logical
later um your computer should now your
Windows machine should now see your
partition now you're going to uh go
ahead and open up you as slight your uh
partition uh so uh when you first use it
you want to format your bathroom with
the little check check box they have
there um select your distribution and go
ahead and just just find it if it's not
in there there's the sh isos which you
can use to find it if it's not coming
for some reason I guess what it does
does it download the iso if you don't
have it or uh no it
gives no it does not but it gives links
to where you can so there's there's
there's a whole list on the on the Y
website there's a list of supported isos
that you can find and you can you
know um so it gives last little warning
before youit create um just telling you
what it's going to do
basically um this is what it shows as
it's um setting it up and on the end
it's going to say would you like to add
more
isos um and you can gu so the reason I
put this in here is what I'm going to
add next is conv by conv and I really
like it I haven't really seen anything
like it and if you guys have um that's
free that that would be great uh I
purchased a $50 personal license for it
um and what con does is you you but um
you boot you boot you boot it um
and and basically disables the the
password I won't over right but it's
really an accent apparently it now
supports 8.1 authorization or online
authorization um but I haven't tried it
since it also has Mac OSX
support um a vulnerable uh for f VA what
is f VA vulnerable
is that's pcri um I I don't know
um so when I when I purchase it for some
reason it won't show up when I do
purchase ore something so I add I add it
with a listed ISO um from RAM and you
can see if you forget I do forget what
you put on you can see all list of
install ISO just by clicking the the
your remov
all um once you're finished adding
distributions uh you want to convert it
back to a
primary yeah convert it back to a
primary go ahead and apply the
changes adding more later you you switch
you just switch the first partition back
to logical and you'll get access to your
um your e
partition um so it's now look like this
right you have your first partition
which is you're visible it's primary
then your second which is you're
encrypted or will be encrypted um
partition and then your third will be
your multi um it's R your Yi it's Ren
multi when you partition it and that's
going to be a primary encryption as well
you can have more encrypted partitions
if you want that for some
reason um encrypting the partition so I
use true I've used true and I use a the
hidden hidden encryption so there's an
outer and inner layer um and I'll exp
more later as
well um
so you can do this with you know Windows
true you just have to uh put the
partitions back and the rest of the
partitions so I just do it when I when
I'm testing the the flash d I just made
out um true is officially unsupported as
of May 2014 um and I haven't I haven't
seen an alternative that does the
same um your first boot up will look
like this obviously won't have the set
that but um but you can you can change
that out and I'll tell you about that
later too um categories just depend on
what
you um
so uh when you first boot most um most
live distes will look like this so
you'll have options you can you can even
install from it um I haven't looked at
the live USB persistance kind of M for
the C live um but it looks pretty
simple um next you want to okay so once
you're in to Cali you're going to start
out your true GP um create a volume with
Partition and drive and there here's the
standard for so if you don't you didn't
know already so standard um that's just
just a right um and just has one pass
right but you're hidden so what it does
is it creates an outer and an inner
layer um oh please correct me if I'm
wrong on any of these things um
so uh creates an outer layer and an
inner layer your outer is kind of your
front Bing you know the thing it gives
in here is um if you have to give out
your password uh for extortion or
something um you you give out the outer
password um that way they they don't
even know there's
an um and I'll go into accessing those
later um you want to make sure you
select the right
partition um obviously you don't want to
accident
else and it takes long time so uh this
is where you select your algorithm your
cash algorithm um I just start with and
there's of resources where you can
figure out all the all the
differ um here so here the outer volume
password um I just I randomly said
people will believe that um it is the
only if you have a f i just made that up
prob um
so
2015 um now
you're now you're about to format with
or format um or encrypt the partition
now you're going want to move your mouse
around it says down there um to increase
the
strength okay so now so you're setting
up your front um what you want to do
when it's finished uh you want to open
up your outer volume and you want to
stick some files in right you want to
make it look um as you know it's you
want something a little bit sensitive
but not something that you wouldn't that
you would care if someone else had you
want to make it look like um like it's
something
important um so so now for you're in in
volume you're just setting up the same
you choose different encryptions of
different different hatch algorithms and
now you're choosing your volume size so
say you put 2 GES worth of um of
information in your outer outer volume
um then you so was
8 put six as the hidden volume
size um now you're creating your your
ooso special password for your hidden
volume this is where you keep your
really sensitive
um
that um so contains the the meat of your
adventures uh here you're just choing
file system type so whether or not
you'll store largers uh store files larg
than 6 on the
volume um so here it talks about if
you just write the outer volume you have
the possibility of overwriting some of
your inner volume stuff and and you
really don't want to do
that so here's where it comes to
mounting the true
partitions so to not your inner inner
Tri partition this is where all all your
sensitive stuff is you're going to just
type in your your super long complex
password um is obviously more sens Poli
your second if you want to access your
outer layer for some reason uh you're
going to want to go to options and
choose to protect and volume when
bouncing other when mounting outer
volume this will keep it from
overriding um
number number three uh so oh yeah your
three choices so number three you forced
some password um just the um outer layer
password um so customizing your
new right so when I had my setc
app uh you customize that by just
changing whatever picture you Chang it
to
640 and just rename
it and there's it's right in the
multi um can you can customize it your
name contact
information backround a friend of mine
even got his flashight back once because
somebody booted it on accident and they
they turned it into the the office but
yeah nothing
back uh so you finally completed
few things so what set
allow or too
support what if there lock on or pass on
the BIOS um so this is where PL manager
comes comes in handy um manager allows
for you it keeps it keeps uh USB and C
drivers on it um so you can Mo operating
systems from hard CD or
you can start from a floppy if it really
doesn't support CD for a CD or
cation so here also is if the BIOS is
locked or there's a pass um obviously
someone can tell you've been there when
you've done this um cuz you're removing
the the laws um there's more specific
instructions online but I just want to
give guys an idea
so there's a there's a battery on the
mother that you can use take out and
it'll reset um and there's also a
password um clear SE jper let
called what about defense so we know
about attacking want to know about
defense as well
um obviously we want to put a pass on
the BIOS and I just went over how that's
circumvented um with physical access so
we want to like lock the case so no can
get into it or um just keep it out of
out of their hands um some companies
such as schools set the computers to
automatically from USB uh to speed up
for Imaging however this work is for the
attackers ad attackers Advantage um
maybe look into some other ways to do
this as well as keep it
secure um yeah so that's all so I just
wanted to do a quick thing so I'm
looking for an internship this summer
um look just a base knowledge see see
what I enjoy the most I contact me
at6 gmail.com or talk to me after um and
I just want if there's any
