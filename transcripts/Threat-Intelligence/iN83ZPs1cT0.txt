yeah yeah all right now Wayne actually
not not only didn't he bring computers
he brought other props too it's
great and does this guy need a a a
magnetic break on his on his rod and
real hell no he comes old school with a
Abu Garcia little fishing joke huh fish
you know no this guy gets it yeah all
right red next in the crowd
let's good for
Wayne hey how's it
going what a crowd this is awesome this
is great I'm excited to present hold on
I got over 100 slides it's going to go
fast okay so Wi-Fi fishing there's going
to be a lot of explicit kissing
disclaimer educational use and uh don't
get in trouble don't break the law what
I'm going to show you don't go out and
do against somebody you don't permiss
for I'm not a lawyer some jurist you
want to know my bio look me up later
okay fishing
Bill Dance all right I love it so many
of you probably know fishing from Bill
Dance some of you may know fishing from
Sega bass fishing okay some of you may
have fished with your grandpa or another
family member some of you put the woman
on a date or man on a date okay I know
that's times I had with my wife hi babe
wife in The Crow but some of you might
not be able to go
fishing always drop the bass I mean the
Bas what so that's go back to fishing
fishing has reached Major League people
are going to stadiums like this to see
guys Chase around and catch fish like
this for money like this and like this
and yes that's a million dollars right
there so these guys are making a living
doing it back in the day I used to try
to pursue this dream this is me on a
billboard uh off of I15 somewhere this
is me hugging my evil twin let's call
him
Wade I used to I used to chase
fish and fish for fish like this and
like this and creatures like this in the
Amazon but more importantly I kissed
just like this okay so there's a lot of
equipment some of you have the equipment
we have uh you know fish here and this
equipment is important to catch a fish
but more importantly nowadays you need
Electronics not stuff like this this is
ancient still kind of ancient believe it
or not that's paper gray scale of the
paper eight bit that's here for eight
bit no hey Bill Dance says kiss
traditional Shar goodbye why because we
have 10in 12 in3 to $5,000 screens and
they're showing you images like this
detail images like
this where's my car there it is right
there images like this it's a little
tragic so I've censored it we can come
back to it later at the end okay but
with this technology you can also do
screen sharing so here I've got one set
up I've got a little device here I've
got a system here if you can kind of see
I can zoom in or out and it'll go
through and I can control the system
from a tablet or phone now it makes your
boat look like a
closet because you have a system like
this the wifi one and this is what I'm
going to focus on today notice there's
something
there okay so notice notice upper and
number only characters so how are we
going to get the Wi-Fi password I
thought about social engineering but
that's not what this talks
about I thought about doing stuff like
this maybe one of these but even better
I could take something like this which
my Gentleman here in the front is
holding that will allow him to see the
fish from a guy like this who makes
millions of dollars a year catching fish
guess what
time all right see if this works so I
put my Alpha in monitor mode and I've
be smaller
res there we go
so we're going to do air dump we're
going to start dumping I'm going to see
there's a go free Wifi right there okay
so go free set I'm going go to my next
Tab and I'm going to take that and I've
already scripted it the typed it out air
dump NG the channels 11 put that in I'm
going to write it out boom here we go so
we're going to try to get uh the
handshake here occasionally you have to
give what's called a de
off so let's give it a
deom send packet amazing you'll see this
this change up here that says handshake
achieve we're going to fill it time
going to go here for this one and here
we're going
to now crack it okay and cracking takes
a little bit of time
so let's go back and take a commercial
break
so the cheesy commercial I get the
keys a lot of fun those a throwback from
the days so with that time believe it or
not I was able to get the pass phase
right here for those who want to join in
here's what we can
know isn't it and I had it working just
before it came up there we go there we
go there we go there we go so here's the
thing I thought the whole talk was going
to be about how are we going to exploit
you know take this over but this is how
stupid this is is anybody once they have
the Wi-Fi key for any of these devices
if default and then go
there's the IP address of the
Box
finder okay so on here Chris has it
Chris follow the same
thing there we go so now you can see I
just connected there you go I can now
see on my own phone what's going on on
this device okay
so not really that big a deal unless
you're going to go around and follow
these guys you
can't
so I cracked it joined it and I was able
to see what's on the screen and so more
importantly once you join the network
what's the first thing you think about
wire shark and figure out how it's
working or I'm going to endm it okay so
wire shark pull the data down oh look
to let's go back
I'm gonna try to join that
no go
sorry so threw off my rhythm
okay
so there it is this is streaming right
now off that okay
so aspect Rao boom we have the screen I
can see what's going on I can control it
from another one I can zoom in okay so
now yeah there's more to it though
so that's where thank you for the
so exactly that's the whole point right
where are they catching fish because I
can look and dream all day long oh
that's cool I have a fishing pole with a
screen on there I can see what's going
you port 80 why is there a port 80 on
this box on this fish finder okay guess
what you can download the USR file and
in laurent's terms that's the Waypoint
now what does that mean that means this
right here is a major event where these
guys are fishing for $100,000 or more
and it lists every person on the lake
because they have to carry some tracker
with it okay so you can go out and see
that you can go find boy Ducket go see
where he is on the lake even from the
shore go in see where he's fishing but
you can pull
his now that's kind of a okay that's
like getting the repo from Moxy Marlin
Spike that's like taking the recipe from
this guy without even stepping in his
restaurant okay if there taken it's the
kiss of death better yet this kind of
Kiss of Death because this model is not
working anymore I can guarantee you that
so you can
it no no you want to get this stuff
because right here you can see that I
can download this
USR
shoot you can download the USR file
mirroring
so I'm going over time you guys are
distracting me so you download it and
what can you do with it well let's go
see I can see everywhere the guy's been
on the lake this is the USR file from
this device in Google Earth you can see
right here where I've been on Lake OA
these are hot fishing spots well then I
waypoints I'm overlaying my waypoints on
Google
Earth oh
shoot boo I just deserve the boo I'm
getting failure hold
on why is this not mirror oh I lost
mirror I hate it when you lose
mirror all right there you go does that
look
right
seriously I'm going to drag twerk twerk
my neck and
drag oh too soon too soon okay so
there you go Leo Lea way points that's
my way points overlaid in in Google
Earth but what if you took those and
mess with it what if you decided that
every part of this lab is good or worth
vising okay what if you decided you know
what I've got some things that I want to
put okay yeah I should right no but the
bigger Point here is let's go back to
the browser which for some reason
doesn't like to show up and
what we're going
do stays in there stay stay okay so
choose
file fishing hotspot. USR so I've
modified this USR file it's called
fishing hotspot. USR we're going to
submit that here's the problem what
would you do if you were a fisherman and
you saw hey would you like to load the
fishing
Hotpot heck yeah I'm going to load it
seebe so what will happen I did have a
default on this what will
see they'll see all these way points I
put in late okay but more
importantly they'll
see the try Trixie was
here Trixie was on their graph Trixie's
on there
okay I added the Waypoint so I can add
subliminal messages all throughout the
fishing
industry
now I love fishing so I have no time and
a couple more slides to go through so so
let me go through really quick is it
working it's working now is this really
a vulnerability it is to the guy who's
15 you're going to dump all his data
you're going to get everything you have
a small computer here that can do a lot
of things some of the vulnerabilities
can be man in the middle
spoofing goer overflow anyone up right
here we we know to attack possibly G
streamer which is the rtsp server I know
that this has dizy box on it
let's see and more importantly this is
the shadow file notice it's md5 salted
some good stuff some of you might say
this is stupid what does this have to do
with hacking this is about fishing no
this is not about fishing this is about
getting rid of the girlfriend you have
who doesn't like fishing no this is
about the fact that right here down
below just above me it says
autopilot that means ships like this or
like this could end up like this if
they're using that kind of scenario you
have military right
here these are drones we already talked
about this in the prior talk Iranians
owned it you got Wi-Fi and cars this is
one of those features there you've got a
plane Garmin right here has the ability
to control the plane Smart Meters nest
remote control we saw already saw our
talks about that so I want
you besides helping this kitten to think
about the internet of things and we need
you to Tinker and
hack and I said hack you need to hack
it's not a bad word these guys are cyber
criminals they're criminals they ID
thieves they do bad stuff okay Karen uh
elazar
hackers are the internet's immune system
okay this guy right here hacked his own
insulin pump to prove a
vulnerability that would basically save
lives so I want you to use your brain to
be a problem solver and hacking the
internet of things for good okay so back
to this which image do you want to see
do you want to see the uh the censored
one the bike you want to see the bike
go all right that's my talk thank you
I'm not going to show an image of that
