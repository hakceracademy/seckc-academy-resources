i currently work for tennival
i build the help build the compliance
side of tenable building audits and the
plugins and code and such
i have a website at savingflight.com
most of what my focus is right now is
trying to help people get into infosec
and that's what i'm talking about
so make your own way means
don't count on a degree
that's what i did i was always told that
i needed education i needed
to submit to open source projects and i
needed all the experience to get these
jobs
and i didn't really want to do that
and if you're experienced then
so my journey started a long time ago
when i was in
middle school i think i found a website
called happy hacker
so i read the website
and i was really interested but i really
had no idea what i was doing i had no
idea that
this person really didn't know what they
so i tried but i didn't get very far
here's some of the articles that i found
telnet the number one hacker tool
satellite hacking
but that's what i thought was cool so
that's what really inspired me to teach
myself how to do it but this was a long
time ago and i had no idea how to use
google i don't even know if google was
but that's where i started that's where
my interest came in so i joined
the air force with the intention of
doing good things
and i studied arabic at dli which is in
monterey california
and
after kind of getting acclimated to to
the language and in class i ended up
meeting someone
who
was in i.t and i knew that this is what
i wanted to do
he was a server admin linux server admin
so he gave me this list
of things to go through because at the
time i had gone through
a quasi ethical hacker course i think we
used metasploit and one exploit which
was like
ms-811 or something like that and i had
no idea how it worked but i did it and i
got credit for the class and i was using
doing a class that was prepping for
network plus so he gave me this list and
said
you look like you have the knowledge
to start
and it's hard to read but basically he
said
build some virtual machines
set up a server with a bunch of services
learn to program
subscribe
to blogs and stuff
so i took that and i started studying
while i was in arabic class i was
answering arabic questions while i was
reading
o'reilly books that he gave me that i
printed off on little quarters at like
eight point font
and i used that to
introduce myself to
infosec and programming and what i
wanted to do which wasn't arabic
so
fast forward a couple of years i got out
of the air force and i didn't know what
to do i was serving tables for a long
time
and
i
was selling cell phones so i was working
at t-mobile
and i met a friend who who actually went
to centric here at kc
and he said it was a good opportunity to
get started
in iit and get some certifications
i really didn't know any different i
didn't know exactly what i wanted to do
so i started
excuse me pardon me here i'm sorry to
interrupt excuse the interruption please
but we have a tradition here at set kc
and uh cory isn't here but first time
speakers take a shot i think everyone
all right
so at centric i i uh they do
two tracks
they do a programming track which is
in.net i think and a network admin track
the network admin track takes you
through some certification microsoft
certifications and i got my mcsa and i
got a security plus and some other
things cc
ent
i knew it wasn't going to be enough to
really get a good job but it was a start
and it was a direction
so i started in help desk i wanted to
get into security full-time i ended up
getting a job with uh booz allen
hamilton doing validation diet cap
validation at the marine corps on
banister road
there was kind of my first start in
programming
we had a lot of road tasks that we had
to do over and over and over building
spreadsheets taking retina scans
and
i still didn't really have enough any
cool what i was doing but because i had
taken a cisco course i was able to do
some of the router stuff and i started
learning
how to poke the servers
to validate what we were doing and prove
that we were either secure or not
so about halfway through my time there i
was there for about a year and a half
i wanted to do full-time development
so i started asking some guys who were
in
software development
what what i needed to do to get in full
time
they told me i needed a college degree
i think i was on
year 10 of my bachelor's degree
and
i didn't want to get a bachelor's degree
they also told me i needed to get some
experience in open source projects
and i didn't really want to spend the
time i just wanted to jump right in i
was doing scripting already it wasn't
good
but i knew that's what i wanted to do so
i did some googling this time i knew how
to use google
and i found a site that taught me how to
do some web programming and i took that
experience and started working in my job
which was officially security
validation i started building a tool and
that's all i did for about six months
full time
i was able to get a job at the federal
reserve doing that
pretty much the same thing
and
after that i got a full-time web web
development role and then i started
doing some freelance projects
um
so basically my point with what i did is
that a lot of people ask me how how to
get into security how to get into
software development whatever it is and
a lot of answers that people will give
you
are
are a path but they don't have to be the
path
and
it's not as hard as you'd think i i
certainly didn't have enough experience
to get the jobs that i got but because i
had
because i knew what i wanted and i had
some experience in in my job i was able
to
just start in a full-time web
development after that
i'm now
obviously working at tenable and i've
had a couple of job offers in pentesty
so
i knew back then that's where i wanted
to go and that's
kind of veering around ended up in
pentesty
so
the thing that you have to kind of be
wary of that
now a lot of people will claim to know
what they're talking about
and i happen to come across a lot of
people that told me to take long routes
that if i had listened to them i
wouldn't be in infosec now i wouldn't be
getting jobs for pen testing i wouldn't
have been a software developer
so
it's important to find people who know
what they're talking about and ask
places like this are great because
there's lots of really good
skilled people
and they'll know how to get where they
go they'll give you a path to take and
um it's important to consider that but
it's also important to consider what you
want
and that's what i did i knew that i
didn't want to necessarily finish my
degree i did eventually but it wasn't
until after i got my job
so there's definitely
bypasses to getting into where you want
how expensive it would it be to just
skip practice and get right to perfect
my wife tells me that
th that's me
there's a lot of times where i just want
to get right into it
and the key thing to remember when when
you want to get a job in infosec or
you can get your available on if some
experience is a great way to put uh
put in front of an interviewer and tell
them here's here's what i've had
experience with here's what i've built
and it's good one because i've always
been able to say this is stuff that i
worked on my own time i didn't do it
full time
and managers like that
so it's helped me for sure get it get
the jobs that i've gotten
tenable was one of those
i do work at work which is
like i said just
make sure that if you
if you have an opportunity at work to do
what you want
try and incorporate that into what you
do day-to-day because the full-time
experience of doing that is
is irreplaceable you can't you can't get
update your resume with those
experiences
is what i did so everything that i did
basically i put on my resume
no matter what it was if i if i worked
with
tomcat and i wanted a development role i
put tomcat and they didn't need to know
that it wasn't at a full-time job
i knew how to set it up i knew how to
develop code for it and that was what
mattered to managers and it got me into
places that i wouldn't have been able to
get
um i think the most important thing that
i've run across is i did this a lot on
my own i had one person at that sheet
that was up there that gave me some
advice and some direction and it was
great because he encouraged me
and he kind of gave me a route to take i
didn't finish it
based on what he wanted but
i was able to start
and i had a path you can google any
topic right now on how to get a job
reddit will have 100
different
different questions about how do i get
into this and some people are mean some
people are
nice some people will give you valid
answers some people don't
so
it's really important to find someone
who knows what they're talking about
don't just take advice from anyone
ask people who are in it
and
get information from them about how they
got in and
what what you should do
uh to get where you want to go that's uh
that's probably the most important thing
helping people out and if if you're
already in infosec or you're already a
developer find people that want to get
into where you are and help them
i wish i had someone i know that there
are people that uh that want help so
it's it's key to to uh
to filling the gap the cyber gap i guess
is what
