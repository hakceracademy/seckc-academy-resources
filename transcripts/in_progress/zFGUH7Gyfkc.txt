hell yeah shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
up shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
everyone everybody shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
there we go that
works who needs a microphone not this
guy not me no s ladies and other
stuffs uh hi long I know see everybody
quick show out of hands whose first time
is it out of curiosity all right all
right
yeah liar team get out of here well
welcome all of you uh hopefully it's
been entertaining A man this mouse was
very very sensitive I didn't to scroll
forward yet um so every couple every
year we have a couple of metat talks
mixing it somewhere and he he said that
and I thought that was a pretty good way
to phrase it um and this is one of those
meta talks uh and this is going to be on
the importance of community in general a
little bit mostly about SE um if you
haven't volunteered it's a lot of fun
kind of sucks a little bit we'll talk
about it though um maybe I can convince
you to join up maybe not who knows
hopefully I'll make you laugh though uh
all right without further Ado so first
piece of advice I have just in general
don't listen to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from somebody you
might in a position to be telling you
that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] um this is a slide of things
that I either am or do uh I'm not going
to go into them just know that I've
managed to accidentally trick a number
of people into thinking that I know what
I'm talking about um let me also be the
first to assure you that if this looks
impressive in any way shape or form be
happy to know that my primary goal in
life is to play more video games or
become a couch okay so this is
you know it's maybe a little ler maybe
you know who knows I'm a lazy person I
like to think all
right so let's see here we go oh there
we go there's a lot of places that I can
start this story off and it's try cliche
as it is I kind of figured starting a
childhood was the right place now if you
look at this little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lady killer
up here all
right you'll see it's me it's me little
man uh there's not a lot right as a
child that you can do to contribute to
community obviously
like she keeps changing as I'm speaking
this is trippy um there's not a all you
can do to contribute but being a part of
you know having friends and all that
that's that's like good for
development uh I didn't have a lot of
those uh the '90s were a really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
rough time in public school uh you know
why you know how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] excited I look
for that Old Navy
12 let me tell you the ladies didn't
know what hit him when that Legend of
the Five Rings tournament t-shirt and
the Puka shell necklace
with the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hair someone just called
me Fred Durst I'm personally offended
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you get
me that was a good one it's is what I
mean by that for the record so why do I
bring all of this up all right in
hindsight right which is 2020 right I
gotta say little Aaron was a pretty
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shitty kid all right uh and if I
take more than a couple of seconds
though to reflect on the
why is not really hard for me to
consider that I was just really trying
to fit in uh to be accepted by peers
pretty sure a lot of us you know have
been through that at some point maybe
you're going through it now if so you're
in the right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] place that's
awesome um but yeah you know it kind of
makes sense uh kids are shitty right
it's really hard to make a kid not be
shitty most of your kids are shitty at
some point hopefully not like
perpetually but like yeah you you know
it you're lying to yourself if you think
they're not uh as much as I hate to ruin
the element of Storytelling surprise
spoiler I turned out
okayish uh you know so not not everyone
does though right uh and I say this
because this community is awesome and
that we welcome [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anybody that's
interested right and as a result of that
you might wind up running into people
who um think differently who you know
react to certain things who might not
have the same world viiew as you uh and
what's really cool about this community
is that most of the time those two
people can like learn how to teach each
other to respect each other's worldview
uh if you're not doing that you are
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up and I will personally come
at you now fast forward a little
sometime around the age of 13 or 14 my
family went on a vacation to the Great
all of the great
PLS I know thrill seeker is a title that
the scantlin clan has borne for many
many years little did I know though that
this vacation would actually prove a lot
more uh I guess formative than I was
expecting so it was around this time
that in the US a game that yall are
probably at least passingly familiar
with started coming around in the US
Dance Dance
Revolution so if you are not familiar
with Dance Dance Revolution it is a
rhythm game where you step on arrows to
the beat of a song playing okay I seen
this at Independent Center a lot of
times but again dork already ostracized
very precious little Social Capital to
be burning on this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all right and I
mentioned to my mom while we're at the
mall I was like man I've always wanted
to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] try I didn't say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all
right I actually Lov Jesus at this age
too
it's there is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] issues in here man
uh but I mentioned my mom I was like I
really want to try this game you know
and she but I'm you know like kind of
afraid of being you know made fun she's
like just try it you're never going to
see these people
again [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me that's empowering to like
a 13 or 14-year-old yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] these
people they're never going to see me
again uh she was right I played my ass
off and well I guess my leg is I don't
know I play it until I couldn't play it
anymore I kind of looked a little bit
like Bobby Hill so you know my parents
were kind of thrilled about this too it
was the first time I like voluntarily
moved uh in in years all right so it was
cool you know it was it was awesome so I
can hear you all thinking at this point
stanlin what in the ever living [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
does this have to do with st KC bear
with me I promised that this made sense
at 4:23 a.m. when this slide was being
written now shortly after my family got
back home all right I find myself at
Independent Center right this time you
know I'm not just like walking brisly by
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gawking at the machine you know
but I'm standing there you I'm watching
this guy play you know and and I'm
thinking about like if I'm cool enough
to cool enough if I've got the hook but
to you know play all right and as I'm
sitting here thinking about it this guy
is playing up there finishes he gets on
he looks at me goes hey you play
DDR of course you do you got blue
hair shouts out to my granny she loved
me through a lot of dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] granny
granny was awesome so you know how I
mentioned how worried I was about
looking like a loser right folks if you
haven't seen someone play DDR let me let
me just okay this isn't that far off all
right it actually arguably looks worse
in real life uh
somehow it's funny that that's what I
was worried about right um it is the
antithesis of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool really if if
we're going to be real um the
interesting thing though is that that
didn't matter right uh because I enjoyed
it uh and I wasn't like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] S I
wasn't awful at it uh were we cool [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
no uh but I mean I guess if we were we
were like cool to each other uh but hey
ring any bells anyone
ha it's it's this R that's us by the way
that's the joke um so what's what's the
takeaway here right um
essentially I don't know what a bunch of
people who come together with a shared
interest I don't know some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
magical [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tends to happen right
that's look at what's happening up here
look at what we managed to put on many
months most months out of the year right
great things happen so I'm going to do a
big time skip here Q Collective sigh of
relief uh to get to the KC years uh I
lost touch with that crew After High
School unfortunately tried Community
College dropped out after 34s of a
semester uh in the subsequent 5 years I
guess I decided that I should meet a
woman who became my wife her name is
Katrina she's awesome many of you know
her and for like five years I just kind
of did a lot of drugs parted worked and
figured life out you know uh it happens
right yeah I can say that I I don't do
them now of course um so after we got
married yeah 2010 uh Uncle Sam decided I
was responsible enough to uh get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
ton of government subsidized long as to
go to college um okay yeah I thought I
could handle it too luckily turns out I
qu this time but part of the reason why
I should be just see let me get to that
so at some point during college right uh
you're told to go to college your entire
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] life you're halfway through
Maybe you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a month away from
graduating and you go oh my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] God
I have to figure out what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I am
going to do with my life so this hit me
at like the three out of five year Point
uh and I knew I liked security like I
like breaking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who doesn't you know
depiction of hacking is cool you know
and I thought it was very interesting uh
one of a few other students were
interested to mou at the time to you I
think I mentioned um and we started a
club we started a cyber security student
interest group and one of those three it
was there three of us uh one of those
three Thomas Gardner got an internship
yeah see some people are remember Tom
the intern I believe was his handle on
slack actually uh he worked at centy
length while definitely Cory and Trent
were there there's probably more oggs
there as well at that time but um yeah
it was earliest years um and he came
back he told us about it uh we were like
wow that sounds [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dope uh
Columbia well kza was what it was called
at the time uh about 2 hours right and I
guess to be fair Trix KC was my first Z
KC event set the bar kind of high guys
uh now those of you I guess who knows
what Trix Casey is real quick
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're old okay uh for those of you
that didn't look back like I'm not even
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you five people raised their
hand uh Trick's KC was like uh a mini
depc basically so there's like an AMC
movie theater over an overl part they
sell beer uh this was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
mindblowing to you know I guess I was of
age but still I didn't expect to see
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beer the there's these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
smart [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that are standing up
here presenting on a movie screen I'm up
here in this basic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Dollar Store
thing they get like an IMAX thing right
they're up there [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shitfaced
demonstrating exploiting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
on airplane Wi-Fi turning off
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lights from their car
outside all kind of hilarious creepy
amazing cool
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool all
right
I this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
though we should probably do this again
sometime by the way uh just
FYI so in fact I thought it was so
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool that I would continue to
drive up here every Patch Tuesday from
Columbia for about six [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] years now
that sounds pretty wild all right hey
Ard raise your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hand Arden among
other people from your crew raise your
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hand yeah all those
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] came from Iowa all right
SE DSF is a sister community that we
have over what we
love okay yeah yeah we love that I
thought I thought you were throwing
shade uh uh they come out there we need
to do a better job of coming out and
showing them love so there's what first
Tuesday is that right first Tuesday okay
first Tuesday Thursday Thursday Thursday
my bad one of those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] days
whatever uh let's see there was that oh
oh and actually okay I forget the cat's
name I'm looking at you though Stand Up
yeah you know I'm talking to you this
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] though walked from Lawrence
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Kansas to come here
tonight this takes the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
Pake I thought I was going to flex real
hard on you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tonight but
that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
no that guy haser a drink I'll buy a for
nobody else does so I'm quite sure I
missed a meeting over those six years
you know meeting or two but not many all
right uh I may have known that I wanted
to get into infoset after seeing trick
casc like that solidified it but I still
didn't know how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it was going to
happen you know uh I figured that I
would just keep going to these and you
know watching presentations and you know
learning [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know taking notes
um and just like figure it out it see
seemed like a fair plan sure I did kind
of luck out with that um so that's cool
um and then that's why I'm pretty
passionate about um getting people
involved uh and mentoring as well right
uh every person that so if you are a new
person and you are looking around and
you are seeing some grave beard
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know that they also cut
their teeth even though they might not
be able to remember anymore and all you
old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that are in this room
remember that these young
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] have some pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
good ideas at the end of the day all
right yeah I know I know you don't want
to hear it we're old we don't like
change but to be fair pay attention to
them right and teach them I guess maybe
is if if you don't like the way that
they're thinking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] change it right
fix the problem don't be a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
don't talk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on them we that doesn't
happen here for the record I'm just got
myself amped up I'm
sorry all of this isn't anything new all
right my biggest points here are all of
you newbies that are here and there are
a number of you who you know raise your
hand first time out here feel
comfortable joining a conversation
asking clarifying questions when
somebody lists off a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] acronym
that you've never heard before trust me
it there's a lot of them all right and
it never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ends uh stop them be
like yo the what one now it's fine it's
fine I do it all the time uh if someone
is a dick to you about it come find
me I'll take
care uh all of you old heads also need
to be looking around all right you need
to be watching out for the new person
that comes in here and is standing by
themselves and is
listening but not really like hanging
out with anyone right now I will caution
this is this there is line to walk right
because not everyone wants to be social
okay and I'm not saying if you come here
expect to be talked to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz
there are some nights where I'm not
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] feeling it either all right if
you ever notice when I go hid somewhere
it's either I'm smoking like a chimney
or I'm hiding all right so it it happens
all right you do not have to socialize
while you're out here but if someone
comes up to you and like you know tries
to get you in a combo just very politely
be like oh thanks I'm I'm good though
you know I'm just chilling then that's
fine you know same thing there if
someone is a dick about that oldheads
know what to do we'll we'll teach them
we'll teach them how we play around here
um but I get it right you know um it can
be it can be scary to put yourself out
there essentially uh especially whenever
you see some of the some of the talks
that that have this talk is not
technical in nature right I'm not wowing
you with any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool tricks or
exploits but we have those talks all
right we've got YouTube channel you can
go watch past talks there have been some
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wild ass talks that we have had
the pleasure of getting to record and
play for you all um and I can understand
how intimidating that can be right uh
old heads and new heads yeah just
remember someone that someone might not
want to engage in conversation and if
you get that five maybe just let him let
them go so speaking of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wild
presentations we've had a little bit of
set Casey Lord time I can tell you
precisely what I went from being a
member of set KC to a volunteer at set
KC One Night in
2016 we had John strand come out and he
gave us an amazing talk yes it was
recorded yes you should go watch it
called what if I woke up evil okay now
I'm going to get like I guess I'm
actually not going to get to that go
watch the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk but before he
gave his talk that night we used to have
a bit where
uh folks who were hiring could get like
you know 30 seconds on the mic say you
know real quick this is my company this
is you know the you know position I'm
hiring for if you're interested if that
sounds cool talk to me you know blah
blah blah it was cool uh
so I I always I I like to be subversive
uh if you haven't figured that out uh
and one night I went up to Cory uh
another another one of the oldheads and
I said hey has anybody ever gone up for
the hiring segment and said that I'm
hiring to the position of my boss and Cy
said no that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hilarious you
want to go up there now I was like okay
uh you know I go up there you know I was
actually in like a like a shitty suit
that night uh because I had had a job
interview that day uh and so I go up
there I'm kind of feeling myself you
know you you know I'm like yeah I'm
hiring for the position of my boss and
I'm feeling myself until here from on
stage and now you're going to get a live
stage John decided that my HSB should be
rewarded with a live interview with the
cat that for every question I got wrong
too I'm not going to lie the only
specific question I remember was being
asked what the process of the three-way
handshake is I got it wrong in case you
were wondering uh but there were two
things that I do distinctly remember
from the evening the first was having to
have my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ta drive us halfway back
to Columbia that night because I was too
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drunk to do it
myself that was good thing Nick you are
tight appreciate you uh and Alex lurman
posting in the slack the next morning so
night I don't really know what the
takeaway from this should be be
unabashedly yourself get drunk in public
subject yourself to mild ridicule for
the enjoyment of
others yes yeah yeah thank you DJ Johnny
father alive give it up for him real
quick I
got
I guess maybe to be TR again uh the
takeaway is just put yourself out there
sometimes it works out sometimes the
funny thing is like I I did get a job
offer the next day uh not from anyone
ATC actually um but I had interviewed
with Bizou that night before coming out
and I guess they like what they saw and
I don't think anyone would have blamed
me if I had stopped coming out at that
point um but I didn't right I went the
opposite direction uh it made
volunteering a little easier I was
suddenly in the field I finally made it
there's air quotes happening here but
got to hold a m and a mouse um I really
can't understate how much I attribute my
growth in that particular all Su a lot
of success honestly but that particular
you know uh higher to the constant
exposure to new ideas uh and just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
that M let me think here 70% of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
that people say up here goes over my
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] head okay ah yeah okay we'll say
70 now if you relate to that the trick
is to Google about it later and learn
okay that's the difference go do that it
sounds [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dumb and silly uh now
there's at least a couple of brain cells
rattling around up here still you know I
don't like oh completely to se but I
really do uh you know attribute a lot to
it you know learning how to build a home
lab learning what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a home lab
was my home lab was a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh
but you know what I tried something uh
and unless you're going for like you
know one of the Fortune 50 companies or
some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dirty secret the fact that you
actually [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] try is going to put you
so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] places ahead of the
other applicants in that pool
literally like talk to me if you want to
um so why do I bring this up all right
because I see a lot of people comparing
themselves to others I have
significantly less technical expertise
than dozens of you in this room likewise
I probably have significantly more than
maybe a dozen of you all right um
despite that you know I have a tendency
to assume assum that regardless what it
is if I know something [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it everybody
else does too right again remember I
want to play video games I want to
become a couch okay I don't assume I'm
room but you shouldn't assume that okay
something that I started realizing was
that you should just kind of like start
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] writing down what you do and
what you Le uh ideally a good security
talk by the way it's just a bunch of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] memes and it's a thinly veiled
comedy sketch um but you know record
what you do right keep track of that and
then when you see conferences get posted
and they have a call for papers they
have a call for presentations submit
something okay the worst that can happen
is you get told
nope but sometimes you get told yeah at
the end of the day it's not you you
shouldn't be you
know let the people that run the
conferences decide whether or not you're
good enough for
them that's my advice and if you get
burned too many times by that you feel
like well maybe there's something I'm
doing wrong again come talk to me come
talk to an old head that's what this
community is for theme um all right I
mentioned earlier that I am passionate
about mentoring right I am also
passionate about mental health probably
comes as no shocker after what 27
minutes of word vomit to y'all uh that I
kind of struggle with some of that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
too okay uh I feel really fortunate to
have been able to you know cut my teeth
at the zoo but after a
while you know how things go right um
you know you start to feel overworked
underappreciated
underpaid in truth I probably overworked
and underappreciated
myself now you me a
teacher I appreciate you Aaron to teach
people F the dramatic pause the dramatic
pause was so I could then drop the
Hammer with nobody goes into higher
education to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Rich so I ain't
blaming anybody from the under all right
that is nobody's fault um and I I want
to actually very explicitly state I'm
going to look at the camera shouts out
to maou for giving that opportunity and
really in general uh you know just
working to ensure that it had some
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] semblance of equal pay with
private
[Applause]
sector there we
go I'm going to
cry not actually that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] comes later
um let's see where was I here burnout
burnout is also right up there along
side um it's basically tied I think with
not getting enough sleep uh when it
comes to like slowburn negative effects
if you are under the age of 25 you can
ignore that part right now you're a
superhero go you can just not sleep for
a while and it's fine eat a bowl of
ramen you know take a cult shower you're
good if you are over
35 from someone else who is all just
stop you really get the 8 hours I feel
so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lame I to say this but the
difference between air and after 8 hours
of sleep and air and after even 6 hours
of sleep is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] St all right uh and
that you know that time's not for you
know it's the same for everybody know
yourself get get sleep you know stay
hydrated all that fun [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I know
unsolicited life advice boring you want
to know why setc is cool uh and why
don't she keep doing it so sekc is a
really great place to just have
technical discussions with peers it is
also a great place to vent your
frustrations to people who get it all
right and what do I mean by that
so I love my wife to death all right but
unless your significant other works in
the same field it can sometimes be
difficult to get objective feedback or
to have someone fully pars and
understand work related to work you know
professional um you know situations um
and again for better or worse I assume
that I am a idiot and that um you know
if something is going wrong in my life
that it is my fault um that is not
healthy but I prefer it to the other
side of the spectrum um talking to your
professional peers can be a pretty good
sanity check for that that is something
that has helped me quite a bit over the
years and I can literally not look
anywhere in this room without seeing at
least like three or four of you who have
you know given me some of that feedback
who have helped me directly over the
years and again many of you first time
many of you not your first time
hopefully you know I'm not the only one
that's had that experience um hopefully
you guys stick around um big folks that
I want uh big thing that I want folks to
take from this uh is that you know SE KC
is dope right um but Kansas City is a
buzz with technical communities right
you saw a number of other organizations
uh that have got meetings coming up uh
you know I love set PC the most sorry to
everyone else this is my favorite child
um but it's not everyone's cup of tea
right we say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a lot and some
people don't like that um you
know if you don't like if you don't find
your home with this crew I do hope you
explore the other you know groups in
Kansas city is my point
there um and then the pandemic hit that
was real cool I was fortunate enough to
still have a job not only that I can
perform it in pajamas um and shortly
after I found out that the building I
was working in was getting sold uh so I
was on permanent work from home and at
that point I cooked up a plan to come
back to Kansas City uh and we moved back
in what 2021 or something like that
maybe late 2020 so at this point I've
been a volunteer with sekc for about 6
years this takes us back up to that 6ear
Mark okay um and this probably isn't
going to sound super crazy to the folks
in this room but uh it is way [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
harder to run this organization virtual
only than it is in person turns out it's
really easy to Wrangle y'all like
hurting cats when I just have to come up
here scream really loud to get you to
shut up and then dance like a monkey to
you know keep making you laugh uh it's
awesome it sells liquor it gets people
to come in it gets views on YouTube got
your algorithm uh it's a lot harder to
maintain that kind of Engagement in a
virtual only environment how how many of
you have been to a conference in a
virtual capacity how many of you like
that yeah okay so the one person that I
saw kind of wave in their hand I want to
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk to you because you seem to
have had a good virtual conference and
we want to learn what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they
did that's I would love that's seriously
we talk about you know I mention you
know oh he loves having
volunteers we don't like have an
necessarily like AC like job
advertisement if you have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idea
put in the suggestion box someone's
going to tell you you should do it so
think about it before we post it uh but
that's that's how things get added to
set KC that is how content comes into
set KC uh we would start hosting live
meetings again for a little while uh
there was that brief magical summer
where we all thought yay I've got my
vaccination the world can go back to
normal yeah well um and you know for
then for the next what year or so we had
to to home
um why bring all that up
well
unfortunately actually you know I'm
looking around night and our numbers are
a lot better uh
but well you'll see at the end there's
there's a selfie that bill took at a
particular talk it's it's like one of
when I think of set KC I think of this
image and we're not quite back to those
numbers yet we're doing good um but that
year and a half where we didn't have a
home and we kept bouncing around that
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] us up quite a bit right and I
don't blame anyone right who wants to
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] refresh Twitter like the day of
the meeting to figure out where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
are they going to meet this time uh and
then hopefully they found a place that
could fit everyone that didn't happen
every
time so I guess why why am I bringing
this up focusing time and energy on
volunteering can be very draining okay
uh I have a problem with saying yes to
any idea that isn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if I think it's
a good idea I want to help it's good
nature but then I overcommit and the
burnout happens and yeah a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah
somebody
passed the ham radio check
sorry I can see yeah yeah look
out yeah
yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah
[Applause]
so I guess the reason why I bring that
up it's not to dissuade you from
volunteering but it's more like if you
feel like glory and fame is what you're
get you poor
bastard you will be a lot of cool people
but you'll have to deal with some shitty
people sometimes and or some shitty
situations
um and no matter how dedicated you feel
like you are or how much set might rely
on you uh everybody has their
limits if you buy me a drink later what
you nud nudge uh you can probably get me
to tell you some stories about some of
the stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] photo conduct is had to
deal with anonymized stories rested
photo conduct don't worry it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
cautionary tale I'm not dumb
I thought it was
sorry so just a set KC volunteers are
happy to you know bring you in to the to
the full and give you something to do
they're uh not
happy uh supportive they are supportive
of redistributing responsibilities when
someone needs to back away a little bit
point and
case a lot of you know me as the guy who
looks like he's about to have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
stroke during the News
segment and as I am sure you noticed I
did not do the news tonight Round of
Applause though for our
news you want to know how I know and
I'll be honest I'll be honest said I
smoke like a chimney I was outside
smoking you want to know how I know the
news was good cuz I was standing over by
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hops in the gravel pit and I
heard y'all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cheering from
all the way out there so did a good job
with the news sucks you probably have to
do it all the time now but we can talk
we can bond together it's a trauma
experience it's fine um there are a
number of reasons why I backed away from
it though uh first and foremost I was
getting too busy okay there are or were
I guess I should say a lot of Patch
Tuesday days while I was working in
Bou that I spent that day working on the
news slides uh and if anyone from missou
is here watching you know godamn well I
worked on the weekends and long nights
you know I made up for it don't
snitch uh second I was getting burned
out you know it's and I think that's
something we need to maybe as 6C make
sure we're cognizant of right don't put
too much pressure on the volunteers you
know especially if they're really
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at what they do right
that's not that sounded really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
self- masturbatory but my point is that
that pressure can lead toward that
burnout you know so just be cognizant um
and then third by sheer chance and and
you know volunteering at other
organizations uh I wound up having an
opportunity to interview uh for a
security engineer role in a US National
Lab
and as many of you already know you have
one spot to Fed uh Hey giant do you have
that like
DJ you have that
noise i' have to be cute up a little
head on
that all right no it's it's my fault for
ad liing all right hold on
[Applause]
hold all right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game free boov
shut up and listen do you want to drink
for free shut up and listen are you new
to setc raise your hands no
all right do the info set
yeah I'm getting confused by some okay
well whatever if you go to CC I'm going
to qualify new as you uh 6 months 6
months or
less okay come on don't be lazy there's
like three four [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like 12 you
raised your hand saying it was your
first night eat dick all right here's
the criteria you decide whether you want
to play or not all right the first
five pairs of people all right the new
person initiates this activity your
first task find an old head find someone
with gray hair all right that's that's
the trick number two ask him what the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] spot the FED is all
right
uh hey B yeah okay sorry you can't play
can I can I use you as the impartial
judge good okay I need you to stand over
by the bartenders the next part okay so
you learn but once you found your old
head you ask him what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is spot
to Fed while the old head is bringing
you to the bar and teaching you about
spot the FED right learn about it right
learn take notes you go to the bartender
okay you tell the bartender why we play
Spot the fed this is where it gets
subjective and this is where Bill gets
the final yay or nay on whether what you
say meets the criteria there's a lot
there's no one answer on why we place
about the FED all right and it's up to
your old head to tell you why we do this
uh once you have said that to the
bartender give your old head a high five
shout set casc [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rules pronounce
the Z not an S and if you do that you
will both get a free
on
so put decide what I wanted to happen
more all right I'm going to read you the
text that I have in my speaker notes B
him and hopefully you also think this is
funny much like how I really really hope
the room is right now uh this so that
this comparison makes sense where there
was once some
familiarity uh and I had grown rather
accustomed to quite suddenly as the
great philosopher Will Smith once said
my life got flipped turned upside down
the thing is it's not really crazy in
here you're all still quiet and paying
attention to me so
well
yeah they can't all be winners right you
can't you can't fire hundreds all all
the time uh you know find your drink
later though I'm sure that I could tell
you some wild ass stories of the
experiences that I've had at the
National Lab so
far in fact I'm going to Australia here
in a month and a half or so to go tell
some people about what uh if you happen
to use the luster file
system and you have usern name space SP
is
enabled you need to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] leave now
and deal with that and I'm not this is
not a joke I implore you uh like now uh
now before the job change all right and
I kind of alluded to this a minute ago
but I fell into the Trap of thinking
that set KC needed me okay I am not too
proud to say that and like I said well A
Pair of Hands is always welcome right
nobody should feel like their hands are
bound and now I keep using the example
right of how a volunteer should feel
obligated to participate okay on the
flip side and I know that this is going
to sound harsh hopefully that the
context that led up to this point lets
you know that it's coming from a place
of love but essentially at the end of
the day as an individual none of us are
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at the end of the day nobody will
do the news like I did but anybody who
is willing to
learn or even just make an attempt to do
can't do it okay you might think you are
rules was good was there a good reason
yes okay sweet so I didn't think about
this part uh Hey like somebody started
CH for my last name like I'll pay for it
but I probably should have given the
bartender my card first whatever add
liit love it um nobody can do stuff
exactly like you but anybody who is
willing to be trained to do what you do
and I think it's very important to keep
that in mind to keep yourself
humble usually I am don't that um if you
need to back off for a while back off
for a while know but then remember that
never think you're too important to be
removed from your position if the
situation Falls for it and that's kind
of where I'm at now uh that was a weird
segue it kind of sounds like I got
kicked out of set KC um no sorry that's
so if you've been here for like six
months or less okay I might not be a
familiar face uh and due to my current
professional workload uh you haven't
seen very much however this may I did
the math and this is simultaneously
really cool and really depressing this
may will be 10 years I have been with
another which is weird because I you
know feel like I'm finally turning into
the 17-year-old I always knew I could be
um but for me St py has delivered a lot
of tangible tangible things all right so
the soft benefits I've taken a lot of
time to name let me just go through some
highlights of what sey is directly
contributed to in my life of course
exposure to the SE casc info or to the
Kansas City info sex scene uh and
amazing opportunity to learn from and
share knowledge with uh they have helped
me make professional and personal
connections that still persist in this
day it got me
drunk like really drunk um I play RF
Shenanigans at an FBI conference with
Bill and we just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with them and
tried not to get caught um asked Bill
about what it's like to be asked by the
FBI while you're taping weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
pcbs under tables at an FBI conference
um I got deathcon got to go to deathcon
for free once because I helped out throw
a
party almost got kicked out of deathcon
party uh got to throw a party with free
boo for a bunch of my fellow hackers in
the Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas that's
just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool right all you
know that's a lot man like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] um and
it's certainly not all sun shining roses
right but uh oh shit2 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whoops um I
quoted a time earlier in the talk it was
like what 4 something in the morning so
here we go reading for btim here as I
type the words you're hearing I don't
remember what time it was earlier but
it's 9:48 a.m. now and I still got to
split this up into separate slides I
really hope that this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] made sense
because I truly believe that set KC
played a critical if not the most
critical role uh in informing the hacker
that I am today I know cheesy as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh
and to that end I mean after I get off
this stage I'm going to go pay for that
tab I'm going to go take a shot and I'm
going to go try and get my ham radio
boner
cuz again I like to be subversive and
the zero instead of an O here's the
thing let me let me just let me just let
everyone in on this job right I figure
if I go to the DMV and I say hey let me
get the license click cave then go no
get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out and here's the thing
it's a valid FCC call sign it's open and
one of the specialty plates in Missouri
is your ham radio call
sign I don't think they can legally say
no
and and I drive a Korean sports car so
it's like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] double on
Tandra God I hope I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pass this
exam
tonight most
importantly I really really want to
highlight is that picture I mentioned
earlier and I know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 90% of you
can't see this uh but we'll like upload
the slide somewhere this is I few page
sorts on the secc.org website and go
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] live the link off the
Squarespace
CDN that's just cool man that so bill is
someone correct me if I'm wrong this was
Bill's uh talk that he gave for deathcon
before it was the dry run for deathcon
right okay
picture lame I'm actually tearing
up I look at this and I think that I
want to come back to this not Kanza [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
those old racist [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh but this
this amount of people this kind of
energy uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it let's spend this
summer [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] building an addition onto
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know yeah I'm not
volunteering anyone
that's but you know not going to clown
car this place sorry love you g uh we
work for beer well
um yeah um I'm done [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rambling uh
if anyone has a
question congratulations on Manning to
hold on to it after all of that uh but
uh so nice I'm going to drink it later
um yeah if you want to talk about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
later on email address is up there and
you find me again shy outside um yeah
w
