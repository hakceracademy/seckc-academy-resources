hi everyone welcome to uh august 2kc
like you said we're social distancing
edition
so stay away sorry
luckily we all have our own unique ip
addresses so we can still
have a little bit of fun um in case you
don't know i'm codex mafia
i am set casey special idiot who will be
doing 101 tonight
to kick it off set kc has been going for
a long time i think we're
eight years now eight years in the
making
it only took eight years for us to
we are the biggest and bestest monthly
infosec meeting
in the world no one else is this cool no
one else
meets online like this every month well
maybe there might be one but we used to
be the ones who were meeting in person
every month
uh currently we don't have a location
but eventually we will tweet it out once
we get a new location
going
keep in mind we're unrated so
just keep that in mind when aaron
unmutes his mic we're gonna have
a spectacular night make sure your kids
are not in the same room
uh code of conduct is not gonna be
looking for the yellow badge this month
instead you're gonna be looking for
anyone who has a cool name
so joel bill aaron if someone
is being mean messaging you things you
don't want them to message you let us
set casey's motto destroy no data
maintain some persistence
and absolutely above all do no harm
these are the biggest and brightest
rules that we have here at setkc
as well as don't give aaron shots after
eight
it keeps everyone safe keeps the
environment fun and
makes aaron sling his vodka back and
state and federal law enforcement do it
in these meetings regularly and we will
never keep a list
so good luck trying to figure them out
that said don't brag about your hacks
and once they're legal then brag about
them all you want just keep that in mind
we will never maintain your list of
addresses names whatever so feel free to
register on eventbrite it makes our
pizza count way easier whenever we do
have in-person meeting
everyone's approachable hop in someone's
dms tell them hey
i did this hack what kind of cool hacks
have you done i went to defcon last year
but not this year
let them know have a good talk maybe
you'll find someone who is
good at teaching you stuff and can teach
everyone here belongs here there's
absolutely
no disputing that if no matter what your
experiences in this career
whether you're starting out or you've
been doing this for 30 years you belong
here and welcome to set casey
do not do not assume
that everyone or yeah do assume that
everyone is technical
and do not assume what they know
wow my brain's not working teach in lean
yeah teach and learn from everyone
uh the hashtag mentoring channel is
available for knowledge

awesome slack channels
this month in particular we don't have a
shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up wall because everyone's
in a zoom call so

definitely have a lot of people who are
ready to just go ahead and mute it for
you
we don't like to do that so do it for us

happens because
everyone here volunteers they put their
blood sweat and tears into this show

out to ben

happen
he put a lot of work into organizing our
talks organizing how we were doing
everything

give a round of applause but just go
ahead and do so right now
