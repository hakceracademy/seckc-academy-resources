for a month and this is our first month
so welcome to everyone here can we get a
quick show of hands anyone knew
one two three four i can't even count
because everyone here is new
everyone here is awesome and that's what
assume everyone here is technical we all
have backgrounds regardless of what they
are
we all have them we all have the same
information we might not know it we
might not be able to
describe it the same but we all have
those fundamentals so assume that
everyone has them
if they need clarification they'll ask
you for it
meet someone new we have a bunch of new
people we just saw their hands
walk up to them say hi buy him a pizza
well actually it's free even better
there's no excuse to not meet someone
new just walk up say hi
ask them what their name is ask them
what they do it's a great way to network
and that's why we're here also to hear
aaron play beats
oh i somehow skipped that uh be the
change that you want to see at setkc
like i said
we have 50 volunteers on staff they all
come here because they want to add their
personal touch to set kc and want to
make it that much better

that we could do better or something
that we could change

discord you can get on our slack we have
a suggestion box
you can type in there say what you want
