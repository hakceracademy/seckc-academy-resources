all right so prop dot is a tool that i'm
going to share with you today um my name
is dusty i'm a security analyst at
touchdown information systems and i'm a
huge homolog fan uh one or two so if
there's any other homologans here
whatever i say has no reflection on my
employer i'm not a lawyer but i love
crack drama so any of my order fans also
was released by austrian cert i guess
it's a couple years old but still in
beta
it works on windows or linux
but you're looking at like religious
processes or interesting processes or
binaries
that are unique to windows
because you're going to use windows
system terminals
process monitor and
to use it you need graphics and either
window for windows or tcp dump for linux
and what it's going to do is it's going
to take your process monitor log
in a csv format and a pcap from
wireshark or window or whatever tool you
want to use and create a single timeline
and graph it out for you using graphics
so it doesn't show you anything you
can't see using other tools it's not
going to
find the malware that's hidden in your
network or the intruder that's been
stealing your data for two years that
you don't know about it's not going to
give you a you can't pack what you can't
see kind of
you know advantage
it's basically just going to make your
life a little bit easier so if you do
any kind of software white listing
and you approve software that gets added
to the whiteness
or you uh
if you do any kind of behavioral malware
analysis
then this hopefully will save you quite
a bit of time if anyone's ever looked
through a process monitor
log file that's you know you generate a
few thousand
for those of you that are new here and
maybe due to the hacking community
generally a lot of places that you go
has a little tradition where this is
your first time speaking in a certain
venue that you're forced to drink it's
kind of loosening you up a little bit
right right
so no no no usually i haven't partaken
this if you've ever been in defcon you
know it's actually funny major mal three
data it's major malfunctions from
definitely people have met major before
so i'm on this goon list we're
discussing things and we're talking
about different shirts and
believe it or not there is bureaucratic
nonsense going on about what colored
shirts all the guns you're going to wear
this year one of the things the major
pointed out is if you see a speaker go
and you go up and ask the question he's
likely to either help you or make you
drink hard alcohol
i ask them why not both but hey once
again everywhere again so i'm making
this gentleman drink heart alcohol right
now
thank you for speaking
first
cheers
all right
okay
so
you use windows system journals if you
use that for anything else great if you
haven't used that and you do anything
with microsoft
you should go check the tools out
there's a lot of really cool stuff that
you can do
um you can do what it says i think
everyone can read the most important
thing when you download product is to
use the readme there's some
configuration you need to do in procmod
to make it work correctly
so
that's that's my slide so far i'm going
to show you a little bit of
what it actually does or i'll show you
so this is a
powerlet's trojan it's something that
kind of started making its way around
that summer and the fall a little more
press
it is a trojan that writes itself into
the registry and calls itself from the
registry
through powershell and starts making
calls to a cnc server
it's kind of a pain in the ass to find
and figure out what's going on because
it injects itself into other services
and so i thought it'd be fun to throw it
into proctop and see what it looked like
so
what prompt has done is it's taken i'm
not sure if you can see my mouse here
it's taking my csv from brockpon and a
pcap when i executed this on a windows
virtual machine
and it has a little drop down here that
lets you choose which process you want
to start uh your graph hack which where
you want to
go so i had a dropper file that i found
on some forum that
i probably didn't want to run on my
regular machine
and you hit refresh and you get this
nice pretty graph
which is
not really easy to read on its own
but you can kind of follow
the line of you know what happens
as it moves through your system and
kind of digs itself in
writing to registries and so forth
what
i wrote dot does
is it will create either node or an a uh
i think it's a match
we'll verify but these lines all mean
something based on the color and their
boldness and some of these so the color
code if it's red it was deleted during
execution
and there's a whole key to what
everything means in the manual
but the really nice thing that proctor
does is if you hit this little button in
the bottom you can actually
watch and in real time kind of timeline
on
what's happening as it moves around and
you can slow it down or speed it up
you can step through it and it makes the
process of looking through that process
so
if you do look at the manual you'll see
kind of what these edges and notes
represent you have a chance to check out
that's pretty cool is it does it work
with other kind of timeline value or
kind of stuff like the timeline
things or anything like that or
there so
good stuff well thank you very much now
and don't forget
everybody that speaks gets to reach into
forty's magic bag to blow up some treats
corey can't be here tonight
so trent is the bearer of corey's magic
bag
so reach out in there get something good
that's a shirt it's a t-shirt we all
