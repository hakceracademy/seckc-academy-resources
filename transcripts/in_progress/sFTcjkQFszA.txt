the name look it up he has a great
history on the internet dos King
prevention King you ever been called
that before first for set KC right
there all right I'm gonna turn it over
to Barrett and uh this should be a good
time
hello I'm I'm a little tired I think
I've been speaking for almost five hours
today about the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so um instead
of talking about dos for a few minutes
I'll show you what I was doing last week
um there's this thing called Burning Man
kind
hello all right it's working cool so
yeah we built this art car and uh it has
a 70,000 watt sound
system uh it's driven Mexico
City Mexico to the Nevada
desert and uh
logistically it's an incredible
challenge just to make this whole stupid
thing work um so it's pretty much the
most geekiest machine you could build
except for when you finished building it
you have like half naked women dancing
around it the whole time
so um so anyway the thing's called Mayan
Warrior and called that because a bunch
of my friends from Mexico wanted to do
something that was kind of like
culturally connected to their history we
built the art card and it's it's a
pretty intense thing so it's computer
controlled the whole Dam thing including
the steering system which is all through
playst
on
massive so anyway that's what I've been
doing last couple
weeks so I'll I'll go ahead and kind of
stuff you want to play I play one
so and also like all the DJs that play
on it we like hand select from all over
the world and we built a camp that
supports so the camp is built out of
like shipping containers that we
converted to trailers one's like a
commercial
kitchen it's kind of like a pretty
ridiculous
thing there might be there might be a
pict of
somewhere yeah so that's like the
camp
so oh the flamethrowers are also
controlled through uh the computer so
it's all done through like this midi
interface like there one big just hack
job of of a toy so it's kind of a nice
way to like take technology and have fun
with it which kind of all about the
hacking experience
so
anyway we have a Facebook page too so if
you go follow it we post like all the
music and stuff for
free
so
anyway kill this for a second so um so
what my career I started uh doing bad
things when I was a kid so a couple of
you guys have heard this story twice
to I started as a kid uh getting on the
Internet when just switch
um so I played around a lot and one day
home FBI was kind of
took nwork soltions can basically delete
Nam
and I didn't really think it would work
until I went to school and
sawn and then I went home and about a
week
later that's how I
felt so I decided I didn't like that so
young system bu
which came fromall
guus
these are some slides I used
so this is kind of the old one so this
this picture
here in the corner was um done in
2004 and the colors kind of represent
I
think
okay
SC so anyway I kind of became obsessed
with this little project of
mine and so often time a writing code
and then I
do
I'll about a month ago so it's changed
quite a bit since 2004 and what's really
ones4 every hour from 2004 to now so I
was thinking about likeing the like an
anim each hour a
second working on software to every time
it renders it kind ofes to figure out
F
place so what's interesting to me
internet 2004
mostly
America and Europe just ofely
grown is kind of yellowy green color and
Asia too is just taken off but what's
interesting about like you see the Asian
Network in redus
the US Europe you can see that there's
only a few networks that control
ISS we've
build
waries it be if you guys can ask
questions oh sorry can't hear me now all
right sorry so I'm a little burnt out
today so I would love it if you guys ask
me some questions I have a bunch of War
Stories so if you just kind of throw
them um yeah well legally I've actually
done oh oh the question is have you ever
been approached to to perform a denial
service and the answer is yes but it was
by companies that were trying to test
stuff out so I think it's
probably probably say who it is royal
called shared infrastructure with the
rsed so they just got
paranoid they wer really service who
Tock
so aof they
HED
compies and that was pretty except for
the fact that I had to do it in their
time zone I live in California and
they're in Scotland so I woke up at one
in the morning to start work um but yeah
it was pretty fun and somebody else
asked me today if i' ever
attacked anybody that was attacking us
and so that was similar
question yes
once so it was like Christmas
in or something like that we had this
control
Alles was violent horrible thing I think
it was like some 25 gab which you know
whatever eight years ago or something
was quite a bit but the packet rate was
really
high really miserable and everybody
wanted to have a nice Christmas so what
we did is we Den service the command and
control server it wasn't take aot just
interon I've always felt kind of bad
about it it kind of goes against we've
been trying to
need
question so the most difficult problem
that I've been faced with with Internet
C so I mean it's not necessarily a
Burns me out a little
bit one of the other had an
attack that was just really and couldn't
figure it out was taking down absolutely
everything couldn't explain
it everyone was wor out tired so one day
our office was in Fort Lauderdale
Hollywood Florida near for Lauderdale I
just decided after being awake all night
to drive home and on the way home
there's a kayak store in and bought a
kayak and then I parked my car on the
side of the road got in the ocean and
just went out there and fell asleep and
luckily I didn't get caught by any crazy
current or anything I woke up and kind
of had a more of a clear mind and we fig
figed it
problem we had so we used Ultra DNS
which is kind of
provider that's a lot of companies use
and I I didn't really want to deal with
tax we just weren't set up for it
likea way
deal and then one day one of our attacks
took down
allra for about three hours so I was
pissed I'm like Hey where's my SLA p and
really think that was
funny
um I didn't think it was funny either
I'm like hey you have an
SLA you owe us money and they were like
well no it's your attack that you had to
deal with this is your problem not not
ours So eventually CTO gu
Rodney's pretty
also so so anyway Rodney meets me at the
uh at this office and he sits down and I
was kind of excited to meet him and he
writes a
check like pulls his checkbook out and
writes a check for a million doll with
my name on slides it across the table
and he's like this check you can have
this check you it if you could tell me
how to stop service and I'm like oh
great cool that's what we do this is
like thank
you yeah I'm like sweet uh then he took
the check back ripped it up um and said
no one could stop service attack you
only against them your ATT took
SLA so then I kind of had a chip on my
shoulder for those guys and one day we
had another pry big attack to one of our
customers and we found out that if we
made this really huge long host
crash the
button we kept looking up this host and
did we had all this crap in there the
response would hit like a a buffer
overlow in so like cool just push this
into our
DNS goes the problem so we push it into
and
because they also were dealing with the
buffer
overflow so I called my sales rep and
I'm like hey um you guys are down like
he's like no that's impossible I'm like
no I think you're down I think we did
it so he's like okay haha you know I'll
go talk to like 10 minutes later calls
me frantically freaked out um so
whatever you guys did can you do the
opposite
so so we did we pulled it out and slowly
their Network started like Crawling Back
To Life over the next five hours I went
home went to sleep like two in the
morning by the
wayns so when they go down.or goes them
also
andar gtld and so anyway he gives me a
call in the middle of the night like you
know
defitely understand what happened we get
aop of Z upload to us and I said sure
only if you give me a t-shirt that says
and and he said uh sure no
problem we'll do that for you so I gave
t-shirt yeah anyway so that was a rough
time
question oh I
don't yeah telephone dos is kind of like
interesting but I mean who uses the
phone I guess it's really entertaining
to
see doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the company the way
infrastructure yeah that's pretty
horrible
ipoc although 911 has
yeah I would definitely I just want to
of so there's a story I've been telling
today kind of BW mind I don't know if
any of you guys have heard of hacker
gok
attack
conne
so that doesn't really sound like a big
deal but it actually shut their office
so it's kind of an
about inter connection
office
all of
them no the the clients that we've taken
on so yeah we've taken on some pretty
horrible clients one client I kind of
wish we didn't take on
was my rbook.com it's like a prostitute
website where literally people
and yeah they were getting attacked
pretty badly it was interesting
like it's hosted Amer and so I kind of
had like a little moral dilemma with
that
one but the
same also gamblings others so I kind of
thought about it in this way it's like
hey
look you know the internet's a place
else's service
provider we are just creating buity for
these people and it's not our decision
to
De like
actually
sound ripped
off
lat
owner
ex say okay well you know there's
horrible thing
about Grand we could clean it up so that
but yeah there's a few like really
shady
Shady
notc you know question am I worried
about my personal
safety not really I
mean no I mean I thought about it for a
little bit and I'm just like you know
you could live paranoid and of direct
way and I'm still alive so I've never
there's you know it was also TI for
life so you know it was kind of like
a kind of like a s
but
fed 18 truck so doesn't look
weird agents this is going a festival
that's coming don't really it sits there
yes so early on so the question we ever
c so we kind of did yeah there
thats all that went away it was pretty
was and there's not much you could do
there in Costa Rica no one gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
so
there that would have been
awesome I have actually no
idea my guest everybody talked to is
IR they have a little bit of some
smart but didn't have any M at that time
so I
would that was an because you have it
was a very well veryan powerful and at
that time the relationship between
United States and hor then all of a
sudden soon as all this diplomacy
started
sobody see it do
just so it's kind
really
not anyone
else
five
andp old school styp except for instead
of modem using F in
getting
G that Bey awesome in about 90 days we
launch it have
maybe Al the the other like a two piece
thing so we have a head we're bringing
into each Town not large cities
get exist so running f is actually less
expensive so by running this massive
head anding off it's really Noto
expensive and so once we figured it out
like we should
and everybody should do it it changes
house
model mind
that you can host full serious weit from
your
living is pretty so the other piece we'
got some really cool customer service
ideas more
can
support
yeah to be serious you know it's not
supposed to be likein where everybody's
in
for research kids that want to learn
interos gers of course this isct a lot
service
problems thanks everybody sorry the
all right uh Barrett real quick before
you leave we have a tradition here at
set
