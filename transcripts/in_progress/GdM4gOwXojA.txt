yeah i know my turntables are a lot
it's a lively night this news segment is
going to suck ass
so i got
it's really really funny that uh
that codex gave a shout out to everyone
that volunteers their time
i did not dedicate enough time to this
this week and i apologize for that in
advance
all right so let's see
joel the clicky thingy doesn't work but
would you uh there we go
cool all right so without much more to
do
uh what is this this is the first time
holla okay
i thought i could hear voices for a
second maybe that's the alcohol
anyway this is the news uh it goes by
really quickly it's gonna go by even
more quickly this evening
and i feel really bad about that
oh come on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this xlr cable sucks all
right that's fine that's fine
i've spent time under bridges before i
know how to do this
all right so uh do you want the links uh
that's how you get the links uh
we're gonna keep moving here and let's
does that one work better there we go
hey
uh yeah that was a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] botnet that's
the uh no don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cheat it no no
no no that's part of the charm that's
part of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] charm
uh oh yeah this was about vizio tvs
making money off of targeted ads turn
that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off if you own a vizio tv
that shit's creepy did you know that
they make more money off of ads than
they do actually selling those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
tvs
this is the problem with doing the the
slideshow manually is now it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with
my automation
that's my my automation the moving
forward there we go
uh the the verizon dbir came out that's
a big old document where you can read
about all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that
happened throughout the year
uh caleb christopher is over by the swag
booth hey ben
caleb wanted to talk to you go talk to
caleb caleb was gonna throw a cool party
about the dvi or maybe check that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
out
uh let's see we've got oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man you
know
i'm not gonna lie this looks pretty
impressive
that's a chart that's a chart of some
kind and you know what i've got notes on
what this means
but my laptop isn't here i didn't think
about that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh well
uh let's see there's a breach from some
company oh yeah this company made a
ransomware payment 40 million dollars
i drew some little devil horns and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and a mustache on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
because he's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and that's what
people are to pay uh ransom
uh let's see we had air india had a
breach this was something about actually
remember this like 22 million [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
passports got compromised
like indian passports you can see i uh
poorly photoshopped in these passports
falling out
and the hacker anonymous is out there
flying away uh
there was a sophisticated fish that
microsoft reported on all right now i
want you to take a look at this
sophisticated fish
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about this is
sophisticated it's all
common denominator people the apts out
there they're all using the same
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
um let's see oh we had a situation where
contractors military contractors they
were uploading [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on flash card
websites to learn
about nuclear secrets but then we can
all learn about nuclear secrets there's
still a bunch of flash card sets up if
you want to go take a look at those they
got the links
uh let's see our evil was responsible
for hacking these jbs
meat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh actually they
actually didn't even mean to hack the
meat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they were hacking
someone in brazil and then our evil was
like yo
we don't know why the u.s is even
getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] involved but [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it
your weapons free so now they can target
us
tavis ormindy is a really smart
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that works for google
project zero
he's got a really good blog post about
password managers it's probably gonna
rustle your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jimmies but i think
you should read it because there's some
really good considerations to look into
uh let's see we got like a new
vulnerable cluster kubernetes
i'm pretty sure that's what all the cool
kids are doing to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mine bitcoin
now right anyway you can get a
vulnerable version of kubernetes and you
can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hack it
to learn stuff or to not learn stuff
whatever i i really don't care
um see the
the memes really help when i have the
notes
in front of me again i'm not gonna lie
i've had a couple of drinks now
i don't remember what this is about but
it's about computers
uh oh this one i remember this one so uh
github is
gonna be allowed to go ahead and pull
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if it's uh being used in an active
attack
i think that makes sense i think i get
it you know what let them do their thing
um but yeah it does
present a kind of interesting slippery
slope fallacy uh
this is one oh yeah okay that's right
the feds were running some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
encrypted chat platform and they were
selling it to drug dealers and uh just
like tapping all their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
which i think is interesting i always
thought they called that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
entrapment um
but i mean what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do i know i
guess uh a really interesting blog post
on uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how how it's how hard it
is to impersonate a device now all right
i know your first thought is user agent
strings
those are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and that blog
post will tell you why it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
it's a really interesting blog post you
should check it out
uh this is another blog post some guy on
mediums putting a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wireless
router inside of a wall charger it's
kind of like an omg cable or kind of
like any of the other weaponized pieces
of hardware that we see but
this guy's just making it himself it's a
pretty cool journey he's got part zero
and part one posted more parts to come
soon
cvs had a breach uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know it
was
some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that that came out uh again
this would be a helpful place where my
notes would tell you some of the deets
but you know what
uh i seem to recall it being like i'm
gonna say a seven out of ten
uh this is my attempt at a creative joke
uh what is it uh
vulnerabilities in 2g communications so
these are two g's method man and red man
uh yeah but um yeah i thought it was
pretty funny too
uh okay and bam all right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
so this i i hate to say it guys that
that was the end of the news as you know
it all right
now okay let me let me rephrase that so
some of you that aren't in the discord
first off you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck
uh but let me fill you in on what's been
happening in my life so i recently
became a homeowner
um which is oh yeah it's really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
cool
except the water main broke across the
street it's just this meme for the last
like 22 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slides so don't worry
i'm just gonna keep walking in front of
this
a water main broke across the street
from my house and my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] basement
flooded and
holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like the first week
that i stopped renting
what kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that i
want to go back to renting this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
sucks anyway um so i've had a really
stressful week
all right i'm not gonna lie i didn't
come [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] prepared
all right you know like i said codex
mafia out here saying some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about
everyone yo we put in so much time and
effort and everything
i i did not this month i intended to i
did intend to
but i mean what is you know intent is is
great and everything but
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so you know i decided you ever you
ever have that moment where you come to
grips you're like
welp i [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
gotta figure out how to eat this dick
well here i am i'm eating the dick
um and i'm here to tell you guys that
it's okay you know what this is a
volunteer effort this is the best effort
i'm pretty i'm pretty sure this is i
guess me choking on the dick
um anyway i i will echo the fact that
this is all volunteer stuff
we love people contributing uh i hope
this is your first night up here i hope
your first night at set kc
is seeing me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up because if i can do
this
anyone can do this it's so easy to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
up
it's awesomely easy to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up all you
gotta do is stand up here and swear for
a while
i really hope the autoplay is still
going
i don't actually know it's a very very
meticulously
timed thing right so i i was gonna just
stretch out the whole time it was like
my self-punishment
like i'm pretty sure maybe i'm
masochistic or something i don't know
maybe we're discovering something about
myself tonight
um but but you know it's like you made
your bed now sleep in it right so
joel can i get confirmation that this is
playing and that i'm not just like
making a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jackass of myself
it's it's playing huh yeah okay it's
it's still playing well
there's there's an end to this in sight
somewhere everyone
um man i'm so glad to be back though
see doing this over zoom it's not the
same
you can't see me sweating you can't see
the individual
beads of sweat the anxiety that's piling
up here at the bottom and crippling
oh it's just not the same over zoom
the nervous glance is back this is a new
i like this

two jobs tonight but

stroke i'm not sure folks
