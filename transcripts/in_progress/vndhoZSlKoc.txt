it is time to have a panel discussion
this kind of came about
because
i don't know existential discussion
basically on every slack channel
there was a question of like what are we
doing what are the next steps where does
set kc go from here
and so i thought it would be a good idea
for um us to sit down and actually let
kind of talk that out and and give us
their thoughts on what
do we do what does kovid mean to set
casey and what does after cove would
mean to say casey
when it comes down to it i think every
organization
in the world is having this exact same
discussion in this exact same kind of
introspection
but i think it's an important thing for
everybody here to kind of be able to
talk out and understand
so with that i will let
bill and alex and everybody else run
with it
so first of all i blame bill
i think you have to unmute there we go
there we go i finally got unmuted
alex are you unmuted too yeah yeah
cool well um and thanks ben i i
appreciate
uh you know you kicking it over to us
and
um and actually everything that you've
done here to get us back
up and going again um look you know i
i don't have any any uh you know real
real answers to this but as as
i think about set kc and
i think about the end of the year last
year you know the beginning of the the
year this year
i just i really don't see a
an immediate time where we're going to
get back get back to that i
i think that that we we really need to
as a group understand that getting 300
300 of us together
again in person is not something that's
that's going to occur
in in the short term right and and and i
think as
as a as a group i think that if if we
start to
put that put that check mark in our
brain it it unlocks
you know it unlocks some things it then
it's look
i'm i'm as social as it comes and you
know it's it's killing me not spending
time with y'all
but we can we can leverage this
we can leverage this this situation in
in ways that that will actually
increase the you know the um
kind of the set kc experience and i'll
talk about that a little bit but i kind
of want to pause and let
alex maybe say say a few things if have
you got anything there alex
yeah um the first thing you said uh nice
for ben for putting this together i mean
he
stepped up i don't know for the for the
majority of you they weren't reading
this psychological chat
he stepped up and was just like
basically what do we need to do
what do i need to do you know to get
this thing going
and we were like go for it dude and he
did it and we're here so it's been
some nice work for that um i mean i
don't know how much work it was
for you ben i don't feel like it's a i
mean stepping up to these things isn't
it's not a small task but it's one of
those things that just
once you start doing it and and work
towards it it's
not that bad either so um
for anybody else i think it's really
really important that you understand
that
that sec kc is a community and it's run
by volunteers
so so as as you know as we kick over to
alex and i you guys need to understand
that that we don't like alex and and
alex and
bill and corey and trent and jurist
and you know the list goes on and on and
on and on
these are while these are these are
people who help
build set kc and help volunteer at ckc
we're not we're not the boss right we're
not the leaders
and and and the way that the way that
set kc comes together it's
somebody takes takes the the time and
energy to
to help push and help organize um
and help run uh set kc and this is all
done
in in the secops channel in slack and
uh you know and and so if we want this
community to stand together and
keep going we're going to need we're
going to need people to step up to the
plate
but yeah so so as i was kind of thinking
about what i want to talk about
to you all is what what
what sec means to me uh and and
hopefully what it means to you
is is it's a it's a place where i feel
like i belong
right i feel like the sense of community
that we have
um and and the sense of belonging and
the sense of
of meeting somebody just like me um
somebody that
that that i can talk about the problems
that that i'm facing
uh will be similar with somebody else
right
or somebody that that is working on a
problem
that i've never considered before right
working on a project or
or uh you know i'd solve something or
seen something at their workplace that
that i've never seen before
and so to me it's it really is crucial
that that we keep this community right
and we can and we continue to support it
um and and really when it when it really
boils down to it and alex when i
alex and i were just kind of talking
about this but when it comes down to it
i i don't know how you guys are feeling
but but me personally i
i need more social interaction right um
you know i'm the the zoom meetings are
great and
um but but right now my zoom meetings
are
you know my social interaction is you
know 100 percent
work right and and i and i need that i
need that that
10 20 30 40 100
to also include social
right where where i'm i'm meeting with
my peers and i'm meeting with
with um well with you with with you all
right um and so you know and i don't
mean to make this the the bill show and
alex if you
if you want to jump in here feel free
but but you all should know that when we
take a look
at at where we're at right now
we we are looking for for a new location
um we found some good locations right
but i'm i'm a lot of i'm concerned about
the viability of commercial real estate
i'm
i am not willing to sign contracts i'm
not willing
to spend money um and and quite honestly
even if even if we were to say next
month in september
we are having an in-person meeting i i'm
concerned about the responsibility
that that is put on on not me but
like the org as a whole of of bringing
us all together
right um and so you know when when i
think about that
it it's it's it's con it's it's conflict
it you know and it's internal conflict
because i i need social time
and and and the and you know this is
great i
in fact man you're just watching the
chat run
you know during the talks i love it man
i love hearing the questions i love
hearing the answers and
and those kind of things and i think
it's i think it's important um
and so you know i was i was talking to a
mentor of mine earlier this morning
and you know as he was blah blah a wee
away you know i i realized that the
requirement of being in person
is is not a requirement um
you know we we can do stuff virtually at
any time
and it doesn't have to be an official
anything um
and i was i'm trying to get him to smile
and he's not even smiling he's
there he goes yeah so jurist and i were
talking earlier and
you know if you guys don't if you guys
haven't had a chance to just sit and
chat with that guy
one-on-one he's brilliant he's
absolutely brilliant um
you know and so so i i was thinking
about it um you know if we start
if we start taking away the requirement
of being in person
okay so if if all of a sudden that that
that
is not a variable that that we have to
worry about um
think about everything that goes into
place it to get sec
ac running monthly right there is so
much
there's so much in the background you
look at what the audio team does and
lugging equipment around um you you know
all of the scheduling making sure that
people are there
making sure that the venue's there
making sure that food is there making
sure drink is there
making sure that that people get home
safe making you know there's there's all
these requirements that we don't
that we don't actually have to have
right now
um and and so i think that i think that
if if we were to start in and move to
keeping the community strong making sure
that people are
engaging making sure that we still are
having big
big meetings like this but but also
encourage the the smaller
you know the smaller groups to meet and
maybe meet in person you know like what
whatever
whatever that means but what in many
respects where we're at right now the
shit's
easier right these are my words coming
out of
my mouth is that we don't have to lug
stuff to the bar
we don't have to drive home like if you
think about workshops how
think about hardware hacking workshops
think about network security
workshops think about uh talks where
we have to be interacting with a command
line these are my words
coming out of my mouth jairus these are
not yours words at all
these are mine uh yeah but but think
about that right so so it
it uh it opens things up right and we
can we can
you know we can we can change with this
but but i think what it really comes
back to
and and before i close is that i really
do
i really feel strongly about the the
concept of community
and and and social hour and i really
want to make sure that that we
keep this up right whatever that looks
like but
it's going to take it's going to take
effort and it's going to take volunteer
like
today wouldn't happen without ben right
there and don't get me wrong there's a
there's a lot of other people that are
doing stuff to to make this
to make this occur but but ben stood up
and said
hey we're going to have a meeting in
august i guess
i volunteered to run the show and and
and so here we are
um everybody has that capability uh
there is no boss there is no
boss of set kc the the secops channel is
is what makes
things happen and um so i'm gonna i'm
gonna stop talking
throw it back to alex but also i wanna
hear if there's any questions if anybody
has anything they want to mention um
i don't have much else to add um just
i guess personally i'm perfectly okay
without the social time i'm good here
but the uh it's it's still good to get
together i still i still like it but
i'm not um i'm i'm i feel like
i don't know i mean just like what
you're saying and we're our group is
built for this like we're
if anyone can survive remotely and
operate remotely it's us i mean
and benefit from it so we can also
test new types of meeting formats i
thought the ctf
in like what march april april i think
was one of our
most successful i thought it was really
successful it was great
so there's events like that we can just
have social time hang out drink beer
show stuff we're working on whatever
um i don't know there's a lot of bounty
hunting or whatever whatever
types of things we want to do um would
uh
would be great so i think you know if
you have an idea or you want to kind of
host a
mini meeting or a meeting or something
like that feel free to um
jump into the group and um uh
and let us know so i think um
yeah i i think we'll i mean i'm not
stressed out about having to do this but
at the same time i think we'll we'll get
some good experience
um to um
with some new formats and maybe learn
some stuff that works even better than
in person meeting so
and from there i kind of want to just
open it up if anybody has any any
you know it doesn't have to be a q it
can be an a i saw that
um i think that's that's pretty clever
um no no asses
but if you've got answers please you
know show them um
you know just how do you guys feel about
that how are you guys you know how's
everybody doing mentally and
and you know is this a good break or you
know how kind of how you feeling about
it
well right so you and i obviously talked
a little bit about this this morning but
coming off of defcon this past weekend i
know a lot
you know some people got a chance to
take part in that and maybe a lot of
people that were like well
you know i can't go drink news on
somebody else's tab so i'm going to mow
the yard and it'll be fine and
whatever.com
that's cool it ended up being way way
more fun and um really a
solid analog to being out there in
person than i expected it to be going in
right you know i'm like well okay people
are going to watch some youtube videos
at home kind of whatever and then
they're going to sit and chat
that's the kind of we always do but
it ended up being a lot cooler
than i really expected and you know
coming out of that and thinking about
you know it was one of one of the things
that we had thought about why are we
doing this all kind of condensed
when we could spread this out maybe a
little bit the spreading it out
uh i think works fairly well for set kc
right you know
if you want to do a workshop yeah but
your workshop doesn't really fit into 90
minutes where we got to rotate around
and you gotta
we're you know it doesn't really work
where you're gonna sit in the dark
okay you know take three hours you know
put it on the schedule
um you know eventually we'll get the
infrastructure built up so we can kind
of consult with you guys so you can help
like get your production value up and
get something out on
zoom or twitch or youtube or however you
decide to do that
and the other thing i think is really
neat about this is you know
from the closing ceremonies for defcon
they show that they had
people participating on the discord
server from
six of the seven continents right which
first of all one thing that we need to
do is figure out how to set up a proxy
in antarctica so that we can beat the
continent but um
the international space station i mean i
mean people really dig
a lot of the things we do and we have an
incredible reputation among the speakers
i talked to like patrick wardle and sean
metcalf they're like oh yeah i've heard
that set casey's up to really some
really cool
well now we can we can push that out to
the entire world
right um and even just locally i know a
lot of people that would love to come
but because family obligations
or you know just social anxiety they
don't like
cramming into a dark bar with crazy loud
techno but this is a great way for us to
kind of bring people into this
so like bill said at the beginning you
know i think once we go ahead
and we embrace the fact that we're not
getting together
anytime soon for a myriad of different
reasons and we start figuring out what
this thing
can be we've got a lot of really cool
yeah and the the only thing i'll add
this and anybody that's
you know heard me matt you know yap my
mouth is has already heard this but
i i know where you're i know how you
feel i know that you've you've been
working on something but
you you don't think it's cool enough to
show you don't think it's good enough to
present on
and i'm telling you i'm looking at you
it is right and especially this
community this com
the the sec kc community is very very
open to talk
to be talking about things that that you
personally don't feel are conference
worthy
right i have talked i personally have
talked at sec kc about how many cert
root certificates are installed on my
android phone
that was the whole talk that was the
whole thing right well
you know like i stretched out to 45
minutes but but the the tldr was you
know
there's a lot of search on your phone
right um and that's not a conference
worthy talk but
you know it it's something that as a
community
interesting right um and so we are
looking for people to talk we are
working
looking for workshops the the pie hole
uh one that we just went through perfect
example right that was great
but that would have been a lot more
difficult
you know in the bar right i love it
i you know i wish i was in the bar with
your pie hole
i uh if i may i want to tack on here
this is my first meeting
um and i i i was invited by
somebody who taught me a lot of what i
know about infosec and i'm still very
very new
um but i i've never been more excited
to volunteer for a community
cool um it's it's like instantly obvious
to me that this
is exactly the community that i should
be investing time in right now
um i i completely agree with you guys
saying that you can increase
the value that everybody gets from set
casey
in this format that doesn't mean losing
the other format
that just means we adapt faster right
that's literally all that means because
everyone has to do this right now like
you said at the beginning
everyone is asking the same question and
the fact that we're in such a strong
position uh to make that switch
and to be in this format i mean i i
wouldn't have been here if you guys had
been meeting in person tonight
i would not have gone to that there is
absolutely no way i would have gone out
of my house
to an event like that today but i still
got to come to
today i still got to be introduced to
you all and i'm so excited to
meet with you further and to volunteer
in the community um
so i i think you guys are headed in a
maybe a much better direction than you
even realized
going into this uh and and that's all
i've got on that but like
thank you for inviting me thank you for
hosting this
and thanks for speaking up i think
that's awesome and and that i mean that
that's
that's i hope you know that that's how
much like how much that means to me
because that's
that's something that we've worked on
for years right to make sure that we
have the right
community feel right where people feel
welcomed and
and feel okay to share and okay to be
wrong and
okay to call someone out or i guess we
don't call anyone out but
but you know what i mean like we're
totally men yeah no i totally
feel it that's the thing i can feel it
like yeah
i'm right on board for sure cool well
thanks for saying that i appreciate that
you're welcome
all right everybody's tired of hearing
bill talk and they want to get back to
music
i can feel it hey guys that's going to
weigh in real quick i was going to say
um first of all thank you for putting
set casey back on again
virtual is awesome you guys know
most of you know been a founder making
remember for a long time but i just want
to say that
um it's interesting to see while i
definitely like the the social vibe
of being in person and i would love to
get back to that um there are a lot of
other local chapters
that are kind of feeling the same thing
so being heavily involved in isd squared
a lot of the same conversations are
happening and you know there's some
virtual things going on there too but
it's the same vibe like everybody would
like to get back together
so it's just really cool and i want to
say thanks again to everybody who has
put the virtual thing on and and i think
we're looking um in the other chapters
that i've been kind of participating in
to
not only try to figure out how to get
back in person but to also keep the
virtual presence going because there's a
lot of benefit to that there's a lot of
cool things that we're seeing
so there's pros and cons of both but i
think it'd be awesome to be able to keep
both going in some context so i'm very
excited to hear the direction we're
thanks donnie it's nice seeing you again
all right well with that let's kick it
back off um
everybody it was really nice seeing and
chatting with you guys tonight i'm i
feel
feeling the love i'm glad to be back
okay bill but you got to do something
about that lag man everybody else's
audio and visual
is synced up but not yours mine's
perfect
and everyone else is wrong and i have a
rifle
and that guy has 50 000 rounds of
well i want to i wanted to say one one
thing real quick and
it's we one of the things we did early
on was we did five minute talks on a
single tool
if you're not confident talking for 45
minutes or 30 minutes
just submit for five talk about one
thing do real quick and be done
i took a five minute talk and presented
it twice
at b-sides las vegas and defcon by
taking that
and taking it and extrapolating it out
to uh
about a dozen tools on the windows
platform that could do a lot of hacking
things that are just built in
you can do the same thing you can start
with five minutes it's a great place to
go
and start working out from there it's
not a lot of time
i'm going to probably spend that much
time talking tonight
and it's not that much time to really
talk
you can do it it and then you can go and
have
like six drinks if you need to have them
afterwards don't drink before because
your your my it it's a great opportunity
especially now
and you don't you can present totally in
slides and not have to present your face
you don't have to be on camera you don't
have to do all those things any of those
things that make you uncomfortable
presenting in person you get the chance
to invent yourself
right now on the internet in a very
specific way and presents
about something that you're really proud
about don't
don't feel limited right now this is a
great opportunity to invent
something for yourself and be able to
move forward
i've had a couple of people that i've
been
mentoring at my employer
who have really flourished in this
environment because they get very
flustered
because both of them are about five foot
three
each and they're in
the i know one of the customers the
senior security guy there is six foot
eight
and likes to physically intimidate
people
the five foot three guy couldn't get
anything done with this guy
until this time because then they then
they were on an even set
there's no way you can intimidate
somebody over
zoom because they can get you can mute
them you can turn them off
you can kick them off a session there's
things they can't do
in that in that session that by being
virtual you get an opportunity to invent
yourself in a new way
so do it step up there take this
opportunity to step
out and do something you haven't done
before
well and for that matter if you don't
even want to do it live you don't have
to do it live
give us a recording we'll stream it out
we'll kind of we'll kind of do it like
we did for for not vegas
so the sky all of the
all of the ways that we think about
presenting and creating content for set
kc
are really kind of up in the air for
reconsideration and it's
actually if i can just drop something in
here because i just noticed something in
the chat
but servo said it that this is his last
set kc meeting
um it doesn't have to be with this
format and that's something i think
people need to realize
i'm actually based out of topeka making
your meetings
is literally like get off work roll as
fast as possible to get up there in time
and i do it when i can but this format
has given me like direct
access to you guys which is awesome
that's a really good point but
something you're missing there is uh
this
the reason this is serbo's last meeting
was not his choice it was one
what did you do serbo to get kicked out
of here
something special i had to do with
uh toner also
robert lewis you're missing the point
set kc is a really good reason to leave
excuses four o'clock start making
excuses
yes or if you're in iowa 12 o'clock is
start making excuses hours
see even better even better what do you
guys wish you were in time zone in iowa
good lord all the way up there in iowa
really
only one o'clock really i mean it's not
it's not that far of a drive
one o'clock it's 3 30 for me i thought
it was just because you guys got up at
like
you know super early to like let the
cows out
and like milk the cows right now we're
trying to keep the cows in
since there's no power to power the
electric fence to keep their asses in
no okay there's no uh no fence without
electricity that's gonna keep a
thousand pound animal where you want it
or more a thousand pounds so tiny
i was gonna say yeah that's the cavs
fourteen hundred
the cows will stay because they think
it's got power
it's the young ones who don't know yet
that that is supposed to stop them that
will go through a fence when it's down
those little hackers
yeah right
thinking they can do whatever they want
because they don't know that they can't
test the system they're like
velociraptors they test the fences
systematically looking for weaknesses
there you go red teamers all right so
exactly so we're going to take a break
we're going to take about 10 minutes
here
and then get around to doing firmware
why is it firm and where is it
