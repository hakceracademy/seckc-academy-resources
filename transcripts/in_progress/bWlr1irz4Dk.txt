so guys i'm going to try real hard to
make sure that this all works i was uh
spent a lot of time making sure that
that locked that laptop work
i'm not really sure how it's going to go
over here but uh so we're going to go
from here um first of all
not even presenting okay let's try that
again
someone should have told me hey bill
thank you my goodness that take that
long
i am doing a pdf
presentation
yes
what could possibly go wrong with doing
the comment there was that i must be
okay
oh crap my timer's already gone jesus
hello i'm bill
um i've been spending a lot of time in
airplanes lately i'm not kidding you
that was like last week okay um so
some flights
oh
before i get started
so did alex leave yet where did alex go
there he is so alex just gave a
presentation about how he can hack all
these wireless signals or outside of his
house
um you know and he bought a bunch of
equipment look at this thing look how
cool that thing is i don't have one of
those
um but i bet if i did i could hack some
stuff um but anyway so some flights are
yeah
this slide was a lot better on that
computer
but when i walk on a plane
i can't wait
i'm gonna
read it
i'm gonna hack people's facebooks i'm
going to be driftnesting
right i'm going to be sniffing packets
i'm going to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] playing cookie
clicker right i can't wait i can't wait
when i'm out getting on a night airplane
boo
seriously
okay so obviously i'm not gonna pay for
free wi-fi right
free wi-fi i'm not paying for that
this isn't fair judges i should get 10
all right
well [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
obviously i'm not gonna pay free wi-fi
so i join the wi-fi signal i browse to
the i go to reddit it redirects me that
i need to pay eight dollars and i see
that there's a live help button
hell yeah
let's see if you can help
so
really all i really want you to see out
of this slide is it took me one sentence
literally
won
no number two was saying thank you you
all right that's cool and all that's not
my trick
um
so
that won't work for very long right so
in fact by me even showing
this crowd that trick that trick's done
right that's not gonna work
all right cool
so i need something a little more
reliable
so i'm on this flight
all right start thinking i got an idea i
got an idea i know how i can make this
more reliable
so captive portals rely on mac address
filtering right i mean we all know this
we've seen this attack hundreds of times
right so
um
you know this guy
pays
and i say hey that's cool your wi-fi
works let me check that out hey now my
wi-fi works right so step one let's find
some sucker who paid for wi-fi on this
airplane
that's that guy
you can tell just getting on the flight
that
what
i'm sorry there was so many racist and
un
like
whatever remarks i'm just gonna skip
okay so number two i'm gonna detect that
that guy paid record that he paid and
clone his mac address
so that number three i can have free
wi-fi and then number and then i'm gonna
tell trent and corey boom you guys
all right guys i have nine minutes left
okay
so step one
i needed a tool to detect wireless
clients and you say but bill we already
got wireless wireshark man
ain't nobody got time for that
all right so hook hackers hoodies up
right here you are i literally was going
to show you five minutes of me writing
code
so instead we're gonna stand here and
watch for five minutes
black screen
hey
hey lady
yes
okay so introducing
so client sniff is the first hacker tool
that targets wireless clients
instead of wireless access points if you
were to take a look at all of the hacker
tools out now that are wi-fi related
they're all targeting the wireless
access points
not the clients that are associated with
them
my tool client sniff automatically
detects
and targets captive portal participating
clients if they're participating in a
paid wireless i'm gonna detect it and
i'm gonna target it then i'm gonna d off
that guy i'm gonna clone his mac and i'm
so
i know that we may have some people that
don't know how it works so here's a
slide we'll skip it this is not a new
attack
i get it it's not a new attack
but now
oh
thing come on
if i have free wi-fi
so my tool
is built on the mark v platform
this is it right here
okay
as soon as it detects a wireless client
it will join now we'll d off that guy
join to connect make sure it's got
internet and then spin up karma and
provide internet for the entire plane
you pull up your iphone
and you think you're joining your home
wi-fi
so
hey alex
my source code's available right now
oh
you can download that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at right
there
by the way i didn't pay for that photo
either
so
i've got five minutes and i'm gonna try
and see if i can show you a live demo
guys
it's not fair judges if there is a live
demo clause because that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] works
oh ouch
all right
well i'm gonna go ahead and disconnect
by the way i would suggest not
connecting
i can't complain it's working mine's not
okay
let's
judges this is not my computer i know
okay so right now um what my program is
okay so this part is me replacing that
one part where i was gonna show me code
so this is all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that i was
supposed to be doing in that 15 minutes
okay well that should work i should get
it
um so what it's doing right now is it's
spinning up all the interfaces um it's
searching um for all the wireless
signals that are available i went ahead
and did verbose mode um so you
right yeah okay good um so so right now
what it's looking for is all the
different bss ids which are
our
aps
okay and it's looking for any clients
participating in that uh in that network
so so as you'll see right now um i
didn't really have a chance to
to do the demo and i just scrolled off
screen sorry um
but what what it's doing right now is um
so it doesn't target any wpa wpa2
participating clients so it made to
detect
some clients participating in wpa wpa2
but it's not really going to target them
um right now unfortunately it's not
seeing a uh open wireless network damn
it please work
um so if there were anybody want to turn
on turn one on i don't know um if there
were an open wi-fi it will detect it i'm
so right now i've spun up another thread
i'm hopping channels um you can see that
i've got a lot of channel one for some
all right trent to the rescue
um but i'm i'm i'm hopping through there
oh i d off somebody that means i got one
okay
all right that was good stuff so i'm not
done yet i still got one minute
um i do what i'm gonna take take
advantage of this one minute i do really
want to thank everybody that came um
this is a really big deal for set kc um
i appreciate you guys hanging out with
us while we were working through some of
the issues sponsors you guys made it
happen i let's hear it for the sponsors
okay
amazing so we had symantec we had core
fishnet defcon all supporting uh and
rapid seven all supporting this event
this couldn't happen without you guys um
i i really do sincerely appreciate
everything that you've done for us and
