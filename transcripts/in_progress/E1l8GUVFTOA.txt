who here has used the John The River by
chance
from the bathroom tracker uh it will
crack a multitude of different uh
passwords anywhere from the Unix tobacco
um Cisco you know iOS large zip there's
over a hundred different uh passwords
that are moved back for os's and also
applications down here uh VNC
uh one I thought was pretty interesting
it cracks by both brute force or
dictionary attacks and um so there's
it's it's pretty simple just to um
using its basic form
me I'm an example and so I either dump a
ldap directory or niss or local files
unshadow it and I'll drag it and send
out emails saying hey guys what what are
we doing here and uh so anyway the basic
syntax there would just be executing
John and a either unchannel or your
Shadow file
ideally you would do a a unshadowed file
the reason being is John will use the
gcos data to mangle and produce
additional guesses I'll show in my
screenshot a good example of where that
came in handy
uh so on here what I had done is uh
send my UMass to a reasonable uh point I
shot up my password file to file from
password field click the defaults
there's a multitude of different ways
and rules Etc that can be manipulated
for how this thing cracks passwords
me I generally need some defaults or a
little bit of drinking if you know that
the password has a particular format for
example does not require special
characters stuff like that you can take
that out of the language so it doesn't
even try those
um so anyway here's one of everybody's
favorite root passwords it's easily
cracked it doesn't even take a second
and it dumped out this
a shift of the username here
user for the three instead of an e
um I should have printed out the
password file at least the entry for
this user the reason being is user two
for the comment I have crappy app admin
was you know the comment field and uh
it's very quickly cranked its password
which is cranky crappy at 2014 so it's
able to figure out a lot of those little
shifts that people think they're sneaky
about relatively quickly
um you can see here if if you press the
space key it'll it'll print out exactly
what it's guessing at that point in time
how long it's been guessing
Etc cyber two per second uh so here
within 20 seconds It crack those four
passwords this one right here
is an example of a password it's
actually a checksum that I use for a
password it's a very long password
obviously but is it work that I added to
the dictionary that I used in this
particular example
if you know that your company or whoever
your environment uses a particular
format for example if you work at Sprint
you're on Sprint 2014 stuff like that
that's a popular thing to do add that to
your dictionary and it just makes things
go much quicker there's also if you're
unaware rock you but back in 2010 or
nine there's a breach there they'd reach
there there was a what 35 million uh
passwords actual passwords leaked in
that particular case so that creates a
dictionary file that's extremely
powerful it Compares them to just simply
using the English language
uh so anyway
uh continuing on you know just
additional words
um that people often find mistake are
are strong they just simply aren't so
anyway after execution uh this thing
completed after you're done if you want
you can see your summary for the
particular password file that you're
trying to crack and uh that's what the
show flags and it will give you a little
report here of a username password
Etc
yes
one recommendation I would have is uh
is going out there getting word lists if
you're into this kind of stuff uh let's
rock you uh password file is very easy
to find there's a number of them out
there with you know millions and
millions of passwords and and other
things some of them charge uh want to
charge you for it and
you can you can find it easy enough
um let's see
um there is a configuration model Etsy
John
by default it'll only use
um
idle Cycles so if if it's on a machine
that you really want to have do some
work change that flag having use uh
a full CPU
um
what else a better password file oh the
updated version
so Kelly comes with a 179 the Community
Edition which has you know zip raw and
all this other stuff in it
the official version which is 180 it has
added the ability to use uh to do
parallel processing and distributed so
if you got a box of you know 6 12 you
know however many cores there's a flag
for that particular version that you
cannot use multiple cores and obviously
things go much faster much better I did
not try the distributed version with it
um I've run Cali on a virtual box
machine ideally I guess if you're into
this thing you'll be running it on bare
metal you know every little bit of you
know extra cycle you can get would be
useful
but uh it's a pretty nifty little
utility uh there has been a number of
times where it's saved my ass
um also in and flexing around with this
a little bit I didn't see that there's a
gooby for it that is maintained separate
of John it's called Johnny so if you're
into a GUI yeah just you know put an
extra n and a y on there execute Johnny
it'll give you a nice little uh give me
Financial
that's about it
foreign
um
