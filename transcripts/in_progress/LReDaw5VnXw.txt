[Applause]
i don't think you guys hate this because
you haven't left yet so i think that's
doing pretty good
i hope everyone got some free pizza um i
just got a quick question
who here was at the old kansa venue
raise your hands
[Music]
[Applause]
all right so we got a lot of old timers
who here remembers what we called the
the shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up wall yeah that's
right so
caleb present i'm sorry my brain is
dying tonight
he's gonna be talking he's gonna be
doing great but all that we ask is if
you guys
want to keep talking that's great but we
ask that you go guys go
outside under the patio and keep doing
it out there that way the people who
want to listen
can caleb you want to do a quick intro
yes okay so for me the stfu wall
stands for say thanks for understanding
by shutting up
outside so my name's not important so
that's why he forgot it that's fine
i'm going to be back there because we're
in a new place it's all
new and different i'm going to be
driving a computer
live demo baby we'll see how this goes
so it's either going to rock or it's
going to suck
yeah well we'll see so i've got a mic
back there and you won't see my face
we're just going to be looking at the
screen but
a quick intro so i got into real estate
investing lately
and the amount of publicly available
data on you
and your family and your finances is
vast
so that's right give me your address
and we'll go look you up see what you
paid for your house how much you have
financed and all that stuff right
so i just thought it was really
interesting from a cyber security
perspective now
i have a paid tool called props prop
stream
but it's pulling a bunch of open source
data right and so
your mortgage and all this other stuff
these are public documents now i have to
pay prop stream if i want to see a copy
of one of those documents because they
have to fetch it from the
local repository or what what not but
you could go down and get a physical
copy for yourself of any public debt
recorded against a property
so what's going to happen today is
i'm going to ask you guys like hey
what's your neighbor's address
who do you want to creep on and we're
going to do it live that's all we're
doing
and we're going to dig in and we're
going to find some cool stuff we're
going to find some weird stuff
and it's going to sucker rock that's
all right mic check oh good it works it
works all right
all right we're going live somebody give
me an address of a neighbor that you
i'm back here in the back though you
gotta like come talk to me i can't i
somebody look up the ad i gotta go buy
you guys didn't come prepared you don't
[Music]
then come do it all right
oh is this that mansion do you know this
uh i got one right now so yeah stand by
all right
so when i go to look at a property uh
what do i do on a mac command plus yeah
there we go
all right so i get to pull this up and
let's see what information i get
it's all weird on me on a mac all right
seven bad
ten bass why do you have ten bass on
that house what is this place
yeah well i don't know why this is
blocking me but that's because it's live
so dennis
something
what do we see here so oh
this person owns more than one property
so now i can see the addresses or
lots that they also own right so i can
look this stuff up sometimes there's
pictures if it's recent on the mls
for sale but now i see this person's
portfolio value
right that doesn't mean it's all paid
off although
open loan amount tells me that maybe it
is all paid off
right so public record does not show a
mortgage balance on this oh you guys
can't even see that
crap man
oh there we go so mortgage and debt
summary it doesn't look like this person
has a
mortgage this is not always accurate
that's why we're going to do multiple
uh examples here so i can't look up any
mortgages on this property because they
i'm not sure there's more to dig on that
one give me another one
[Music]
next
there we go all right one three zero
three two west 102nd terrace
kansas city kansas
all right yeah lenexa sorry i'm just
saying stuff all right four bed three
bath almost
1200 square feet that's that's a lot of
beds and baths for that many square feet
i'll let you know that
what happened oh okay
all right so mortgage and transaction
history let's see oh we have an open
loan
fha loan estimated payment of 800
a month and they still owe probably
about 144 000. so how that works is
this is a 360 month loan that means for
30 years they have this loan
if you can see that i'll put it up high
there so it's a 30 year loan
started on this date or that's the final
date and their monthly payments are a
little over 800
buy some pennies so
what about rent so
oh yeah owning a home is almost always
cheaper than rent but then you have
maintenance to deal with like a water
main breaking across the street and
stuff right you doing messed up hey
ron uh all right so when i call somebody
when i'm doing a real estate call i
already know how much they still owe on
their house
when i do this sort of stuff and
sometimes it'll show that there's linked
property so i know when somebody's
sitting on a gold mine of properties
did you find out what you want to know
about this neighbor or whoever this is
okay yes that's a success somebody else
i had a lady i was doing this at a real
estate meetup and i had a lady
give me an address somebody else was
supposed to have bought the house
that a family member owned but he sold
it to his llc
so he could tell her he sold it off but
now he's making rent money on it and
like stuff got a little crazy in that
real estate meetup i had to turn it off
she got real angry addresses anybody
here we go 1417 south
what
there we go there can't be too many of
those
ghetto neighbors okay you have it live
on uh youtube
details the ghetto neighbor's name is
glenn
ingram so sometimes it's really
interesting to find out that an llc owns
somebody's house
if somebody claims they're the owner
you'll find out actually you're not
either they own the llc or they're a
renter
oh but mr ingram owns two properties
oklahoma city so he has probably a
rental so let's look at that let's dig
so he owns the one local and he owns one
in oklahoma city
three bed one bath owned in his own name
not an llc and it is non-owner occupied
and he's probably making around 1 000 to
1100
a month rent from that property
he currently carries a mortgage balance
of almost 70 000
and we can probably see how much his
monthly payment is
so he's bringing in 300 bucks a month
but somebody's paying off that house for
him so i mean good for him
did you find out what you wanted to know
yep
west 139th
oh that's not going to come up th
there it is all right
what are we going to find here what do
how much is their house worth okay
estimated value is somewhere between
these two numbers it's a rough
between 705 000 and 685
somewhere around there now i can go and
do comps to compare to other houses but
that's a whole separate research study
and not really related to ocean
so five bed four and a half bath and
it looks like they own multiple
properties they also own
raintoy drive and it's owned by a family
trust
okay
so if it's a lawyer-backed trust how do
you get to know more information
uh that's what people pay for
lawyer-backed trusts for
i can't get past that a trust a trust is
private unless
you have a legal reason to expose the
trust document
yes so we can play with so a lot of
times people will transfer
a property that they already own
directly into a trust so you can see
who's related and you can use like
family tree now to find out all sorts of
other who
who's involved and whatnot so let's look
at
mortgage and transaction history and see
if we can find
um
yes it is different from state to state
so oh here's another thing to know
there's arm arms length and non-arms
length imagine somebody holding their
arm out to keep somebody back an arm's
length transaction is i don't know you
and if you ever watch king of the hill
uh i don't know you that's my purse
right so i don't know you but we're
gonna do a transaction between you and
me that's in each of our best interests
that's an arm's length transaction now
if it's somebody that you know or you're
transferring into an entity that you own
or know
that's an arm and wait a minute
that's an arm's length transaction
non-arms length non-arms it means you're
like side
right up next to each other doing some
sort of secret deal so the the value may
not actually reflect
i think it's uh legal attestation that
says
yes i don't know this person or you're
supposed to declare any affiliations
so somebody may not do that and it may
be registered as an arms linked
transaction falsely
so what are we looking at here does this
give you any information
about kevin kaufman
rife homes built it and then kevin
and that's the previous owner okay and
then it got transferred into
the revocable trust so i don't know if
he sold it directly to a revocable trust
or if he's part of that
revocable trust he's not part of that
trust so he sold it
okay there you go give me something else
uh doesn't do very well in commercial
this is geared towards up to
four plexes what do you got
one five zero five h i g h
l a indeed oh columbia
here it is this one
yeah that one he says what do you want
enormous oh is there a house on it yeah
okay six beds seven and a half i don't
understand why people have more
bathrooms than bedrooms that doesn't
make sense to me
what's low battery well plug it in
i don't have a pound you don't want to
see what i plug into it
all right so estimated value between 1.6
and 2.4 million that's a pretty broad
spread
it's hard to tell based on how much land
there is basically i think
but mr otto mali owns it
in his own name and his wife
west west 158th
place overland park kansas
all right here we go is this you or is
this somebody you want to know something
about
oh recently sold huh all right
four bed three bath now owned by michael
shakib shakib shakib
who knows michael
and sued i don't know how to pronounce
that so
don't get mad at me but the second
we hope this is power are we powered up
success
we have the power
records what i'm wondering is can you
take this and pivot to other assets like
farms
can i take this and pivot to other
assets like cars this app
this program won't but what do you mean
[Music]
i don't know i've only played with the
real estate
no this is not geared for me to pull a
source of record i would actually have
to go
to the the local county
record keeping office whatever it is
that's actually doing that
but this is mostly going to be like so
you can go if you want to learn more
information about a specific property
than than a pr
a program like this has you can manually
look up a property
at the county tax assessor's office and
find out
the parcel number sometimes there's a
drawing of the property with the
[Applause]
okay so it's for the whole johnson
county and you can look up so let's look
uh don't use this for entertainment
purposes
[Laughter]
that's why i'm not using my computer
oh i can't see that over here
well here on the screen 6405 west 158th
place
okay so we have a legal description we
have a subdivision
uh you gotta buy the plats so for the
full layout
but here's here's the low resolution
layout of the
the land plat but we might get a sketch
you can see the appraisals and any
contests
against that there you go so now you see
i think that's all i got there although
i have looked up somebody else
and found their new mailing address and
things like that by just chasing down
the
anybody else
[Music]
three
there we go eight zero zero five north
east 102nd street
casey mo details
owner occupied they've owned it for nine
months i can also see
how long somebody has owned their house
ryan friedhoff
there you have it what else do we want
to know uh
mortgage and transaction history they
have a conventional mortgage
and they took it out on 10 to 20 20. i
can pay for a copy of the document if
you want to see the details i'm not
going to do that live now
but the loan was for 100 485 000 so
a traditional loan a conventional loan
takes
20 percent down unless they're going to
pay mortgage insurance so
you're going to have to guess whether
they put five 10 15 or 20 percent down
on that property
but they got a loan for 485 thousand
dollars and
they still owe most of it
yeah okay so then their monthly loan
payment not including taxes and
insurance
is two thousand dollars so they're
probably looking at 24 2500
house payment does this
uh yeah let's look up this address here
usually commercial doesn't do too well
but
i would be remiss if i didn't try it
live
what is the address here
somebody looked it up somebody with a
computer look it up
not good i don't do well on houses that
all right so this is the current address
it's a corporate owner 15 20 grand llc
that does not surprise me a lot of
people name their llc
whatever the address is because they
have one llc
per property it did have a cash sale in
20
when maybe 2010 but i don't see the
price
linked properties let's see if this
company owns
more properties well there you go so
they bought a second
vacant land this is an interesting mix
to me as a real estate investor it's
interesting that they're mixing
commercial and vacant land residential
land in the same portfolio
but the vacant land is a relatively
recent purchase and it must not have
been worth spinning up a new llc
just to hold it interesting usually you
don't want to mix
asset classes for risk management
purposes
sometimes those negative numbers look
weird it's uh
it's hard for it to tell all right
so there are two mortgages on this
property one for 1.9 million
one for 225 000 i cannot guarantee this
information is accurate
especially on a commercial property now
on a commercial loan they will structure
a loan for 30 years but you will have to
pay it off in 5 or 10
or refinance it in 5 or 10. how much
money do you end up paying for your
house by the time you've paid it off
like two or three or four times as much
right because it's amortized it starts
mostly with interest so especially in
the commercial space you'll see these
long loans
but you cannot expect that it's going to
last 30 years the termination date's
going to be relatively early
on something like that so they're going
to be paying interest only
most of the time and they're refining it
and then paying interest only again on a
new loan
so commercial assets are basically never
meant to be paid down
interestingly enough i have a young lady
in the back nodding profusely as i speak
are you validating me what's going on
oh okay i didn't know if you're like
yeah he's right i would love some
validation
yeah she says all right so
wow they bought a kit oh okay so the
purchase method with the county by the
way the purchase message
with the county is cash up here at the
top or in the middle of your screen
that's because they got a private loan
from somewhere else
they brought cash to the seller so they
went and got
financing and brought a cash prize to
the seller and then
when they acquired it they had to record
a deed of trust or a new
debt on the property for the 1.9 million
and maybe they did some renovations for
so this tool is called prop stream
p-r-o-p-s
and it costs a hundred dollars a month
so if you want to look somebody up just
hit me up
and i'll i'll help you out uh it's a
real estate investor tool i use this to
look somebody up before i call them to
make an offer on their house
so i know how much they are they owe
what their monthly payment is
so if i can get into a discussion where
i understand why they want to sell their
house then i can structure a deal
usually creative financing is what i try
to do so that i can
accommodate whatever they need i'm not
looking to pay full price for a house so
we figure something out
another address oh come on the white
house
what
okay who owns it hey look trump still
owns it
no we don't get to find out that
information that is not public record
sorry ladies and gentlemen but we can
see this property the white house south
lawn estimated value is zero dollars
no it's i'm sure it's not for sale folks
any other takers
[Applause]
any other questions because this is all
i've got i'm just doing live lookups
i know somebody wants to creep on a
neighbor i found out my mom and dad had
a extra loan on their product they
pulled out a heloc
that's how they bought their solar
panels
street
the people at this address tried to buy
farmer bill actually it's bill farmer
[Laughter]
paulette and bill farmer
i'll bet no they don't have linked
let's see they
they have zero dollars debt recorded
against the property right now and i i
know that's hard to see so
anyway but it would rent for about 2 500
their property
so go make a low offer on theirs and see
if nobody else has anything i'm about to
sign off of here and let you guys chat
some more
