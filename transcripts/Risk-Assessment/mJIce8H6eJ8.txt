still want to go over some uh red team
tools today with you guys um with this
talk there's no disclaimer uh we're
gonna teach you the ways of breaking it
so i absolutely guarantee if you do any
of this without any explicit permission
or uh authorization you will get
arrested
so
when you're dealing with red team you're
gonna break in and the worst thing about
breaking in is doors they suck they're
always in the way
and they're pain in the ass because
sometimes they have unique mechanisms on
them
so
let's just get right to it let's break
some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let's get into stuff
i'm going to
go through three techniques all three of
these techniques
not only can you buy the tools and do
this
you can actually make the tools for free
or get them for daily or free at a
so with doors one quick thing to always
remember is when you're trying to bypass
them
you don't want to draw attention to
yourself
and you want to make sure that you're
somewhat discreet and quiet
if someone sees you down the hallway
using one of these things they're going
to hear you want to know what you're
so
one great thing to bypass the door is a
k22 hook
and that's what this is it's under the
door hook
and what you do
is you slide the top part under the door
and this handle on this end you maneuver
it around
then you can maneuver this handle on the
top part
right here
hooks the door handle on the other side
you got you got the ring at the end
you just pull that
once you get it on the other side
what that does is that pulls the lever
of the door from the other side allows
you to open the door
from the other side so you don't have to
pick a lock you don't have to do
anything you don't have to worry about
any of the motion sensors or the
id cards you just open the door play
if you're going to transport this
there's one piece of advice
what appears to be a good idea do not
carry the soft rifle case
you're going to make friends with the
tsa really
and they're going to take you to a nice
little room and have a nice discussion
with you for about three hours
so
another great way to bypass doors is
simple copper wire
just the simple stuff you get at the
hardware store you get a
radio shack and whatnot
and what you can do with that
is
open most crash bar doors now we found
that on a pen test by accident
and have then researched it even further
in a large portion of your crash course
how they operate
is they're actually measuring a low low
level current on them they're not
actually looking for you to actually
physically manipulate the handle to open
the door
they're looking for a drop in current
and then they'll release the door
mechanism so people can get out for
safety safety
what you do is you take your copper wire
run yourself a strand of it
poke one hole around and touch the crash
bar with it the other end touch it
lower the resistance and the door will
open
from the other side once again
another thing here is uh this is a
universal way to open up i need to work
without using a log pic in north america
in south and central america
this is a lara's original
and what it is is
uh the numbers seven and three are very
very handy in opening any and all doors
on the
you can see right here you got a gap
where the plunger would go
and what you would do with that then is
take your seven and three
which you have these nice little hooks
and the three have nice two hooks on
them then you can then jam in that gap
you're gonna then pull the plunger and
pull it forward
what's nice about these is these are two
bucks at home depot they're brass
they're not going to break or bend
and you can run anywhere on the planet
including
london and shanghai and buy these at
walmart as well so if you can't take
them on a plane you can buy them
anywhere they're just the numbers that
go on the side of the house
but it's better than any door shim any
shoving tool that you're going to find
online in the lock big forum at 70 crowd
this is two bucks at a store it's going
to work better and
if you get caught trying to sneak in
somewhere
copper security guard is going to think
twice about a shovel tool or lock nip
set
if he sees these around you can just
simply just tell them something like hey
these are my lucky numbers they always
keep keeping with me for good luck
so they work on all doors
you're going to be able to pull all
plungers in all configurations and pull
them out it doesn't matter what kind of
door as long as the plunger is exposed
in a certain way you can pull it out
that way
so
in all this uh in the future start being
aware of all these little stupid renting
kits and all these little gimmicky
things people sell out there because all
these things you can go to the hardware
store find the build yourself the uh k22
if you don't have one or if you're
traveling somewhere where you can't get
one if you go to the hardware store you
can get those signs in the
section where they have a realtor slash
garage sale signs you can take those
frames and bend them apart
and use piano wire or a heavy gauge
guidance wire
and achieve the same thing on the sides
uh if you're on site somewhere you don't
have a seven or three handy and you're
in an office building you can take apart
a three-ring binder
and one of the hooks from the three-ring
binder works
just as well as a seven or three to
reach in that little gap and pull the
plunger out
so if you're looking for these tools or
anything uh have questions
just give a shout we always like to help
people find schools cheaply
and hook people up with other bits of
information
