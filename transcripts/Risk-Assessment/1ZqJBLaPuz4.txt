so uh
a couple things here before we get
started there's no disclaimer here
tonight at all
we're gonna get into some really nasty
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're gonna get into some illegal
stuff we're gonna break stuff and
everything so there's always a 100
guarantee if you do this uh you're gonna
get trouble so consult legal help or uh
counsel before you do anything or try to
so
if you want to know more about what i do
and everything come out and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me
afterwards i don't care about a bio
slime we don't have time for that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
so right now
we're gonna be dealing with adult
content
if anyone has triggers or any
problems you do need to leave now
last chance
okay we're gonna get a card in stick
here
so i do a lot of red teaming red teaming
what we do is we go in and we break in
physically to test the security of
places
uh it's a lot of fun it's very dangerous
because sometimes people have dogs
sometimes people have machine guns so
thank god for kevlar
and uh if you want to talk about kevlar
afterwards let me know
i've done a lot of investing that lately
and it does work
but sometimes in red team it's not fun
because you have a client who uh
limits your scope to the point that you
can't use lock picks
but they want you to break in anyways
there's important restrictions if you go
overseas in australia you can't get a uh
pry bar or lock picks in the country
they search your luggage there's also
times where you uh have your luggage
locks
so there's all sorts of not fun things
with the red team that you got to
improvise and figure out what to do
so that's what we're going to talk about
tonight real quick is improvisation
and finding new uses for things that you
never thought you'd be able to get ahold
of
and how to get a hold of these things
all over the place
so
sex trucks are awesome
nearly every
place on the planet has one third grade
is allowed
24 7 which is better than walmart
there is no questions asked when you buy
beard stuff they're at all and you can
get beard beard
they're also pretty anonymous because
they're catering to clientele who want
to remain anonymous so it's great to
pick up stuff it's also a great place if
you need small high-powered motors
and you can't
you can't order stuff from digikey
or blackhawks there's a lot of great
resources the best thing about sex shops
is the staff there most of the time
people are very timid won't ask
questions
go to the sex shop and start talking to
the staff you will find the most [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
up weird stories
you've ever heard in your life it's
awesome but they have a lot of great
resources when i travel places i always
find the head shop always find the sex
shop because those are the people in the
town or place you travel or country that
knows what's going on and they're gonna
be friendly and help you out
so
as you see with the bumpy hammer it
looks like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bumpy hammer
it's really hard to explain when you're
using a bumpkin hammer in the middle of
the night trying to break into some
place
it's also hard to explain to tsa
equivalents in other countries why you
have a bumpkin here
a giant rubber dong
is no questions asked
more importantly
when you're wailing on that bump key
trying to break in the middle of the
night the security guards roll up on you
it is the best thing to have because
there's absolutely no questions asked
when you're just wailing on that door
because i guarantee you from personal
the other thing is they don't make as
you don't feel too bad about it plus
that security guard's just gonna sit
there
and contemplate if he's gonna call this
it depends they go both ways so what's
this
it's a personal massager is what they
call it it's great because it's a very
high powered motor
but it's also electronic logic
electronic lock picks cost a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of
money and they're louder than a
three-year-old with a case of red bull
how they work is they vibrate
those tumblers and they can actually
damage the locks a lot
so sex hops are great you can get large
or small capacity motors that are
adjustable with various speeds so you
don't tear the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of the lock
again
someone sees a personal massager they're
not going to
ask you questions or do anything
it's very easy to get into countries uh
as well with it because it's a personal
massager but the other thing is they're
cheap
because a lot of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out there for
locksmithing red teaming and everything
is so bloody expensive
so
go get cheap [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because if you lose a
massager or a vibrator who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
cares go get another one
if you lose a 500 electronic lock pick
kevin
it's gonna suck
so
motion sensors suck
we see it like on the uh inside from the
other side of like a server room
and how they work is when someone walks
up to them they automatically trip open
the door and let you exit
but as a pen tester a red team guy you
want to get into that place so how do
you do that
easiest ways you'll get some mylar
balloons
and some helium what you do is you fill
out the balloons underneath the door and
let them float up and trick that sensor
uh the black ones work very well the
over the hill 40 ones work the best
but sometimes you're going to run into
restrictions where
those sensors are actually tuned in well
and they're looking for the composite of
a human shape
so
we go out
we get something that's human-shaped
angry fit under the door and inflate to
trip those sensors
the male models are the best because
they have extra length that you can use
to trip the sensors off
i do however
urge you to be very careful when you
expense this to the client
also do not leave these behind in the
server room or at the client location
because you can actually run into some
legal issues
in various countries
although it's a fun float of fun to
experience a blow-up dog and then tell
the whole i.t department this is how we
so the other thing to consider at your
sex shops is a plethora of really cheap
if you order anyone here from law
enforcement mostly key equivalent of uh
smith and wesson
could be fighting for uh sex shocks for
under a dollar
the other great thing is sex shop staff
sees a lot of beer twisted [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so ask
them about
getting out of things because they
always will have some dictionary who
comes in from the suburbs they use
handcuffs they try to recreate two
pieces of gray and can't get out of it
but they don't want to go down to the
hospital or the police station because
they have pink fuzzing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the
campus
they have great stories and resources on
how to get all out of bondage gear
and handcuffs so again always ask the
staff and don't be afraid because
there's some awesome awesome stories
because at the end of the day there's
not much difference between bondage and
the state of the patient techniques
so
if you're going to get into picking a
handcuff keys or gamepads i don't know
if we have
a fail or a tool up here
in kansas city but if you get into
picking handcuffs
do not use them on yourself or other
people
what you need to do is these are called
uh fisting
uh models or fisting aids
they are great to practice on because
they remove liability if someone
attaches the handcuffs that can't get
off with these you throw some crisco oil
alone and slip the handcuffs off you're
done no liability no problems
it's also really good to practice solo
handcuff keys and picking and working
with handcuffs and techniques because
that way it frees up both hands
you have something to simulate along to
do but again it's great for
uh teaching aids and doing uh uh
handcuffs work without any liability
you also turn a lot of heads when you
whip these out in the boardroom and
keep it simple and stupid because
a lot of times there's so many kids out
there who go to deathcon people are
selling lockpicks and other things other
doodads
at the end of the day there's so much
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out there that you can pick up at
like a walgreens a walmart or a hardware
store or a sex shop so never ever ever
limit yourself
to your resources
and always think of new possibilities
and uses for things you can always do
your own stuff you can always roll your
own optics you can always roll your own
breaching tools and you'd be surprised
what you could find at a sex shop so
have fun if there's any questions come
