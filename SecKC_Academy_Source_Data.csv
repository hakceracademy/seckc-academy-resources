Wait no, make that a ""cloud first, mobile first"" company based in Redmond, WA. My gig was IR at scale -- 100s of thousands of globally distributed systems. This trolk will be an honest look at Kansa -- an open source, PowerShell-based incident response framework, developed with the goal of executing IR at scale.

2015,,Hacking SIEMs to Catch Hackers,Blake Bryant or,YouTube is fine,Security Operations,"Based on over two years of thesis research resulting in the implementation of a “kill chain” framework within SIEM software. A novel “kill chain” model was developed, loosely based upon the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill-Chain, and implemented within a commercial SIEM system through modifications to the existing SIEM database. These modifications resulted in a new log ontology capable of normalizing security sensor data in accordance with modern threat research. New SIEM correlation rules were developed using the novel log ontology and compared to existing vendor recommended correlation rules using the default normalization model. The novel log ontology produced promising results indicating improved detection rates, more descriptive security alarms, a lower number of false positives, and simplified SIEM correlation rule construction. These improvements were assessed to provide improved visibility and more efficient investigation processes to security analysts resulting in a reduction in the mean time required to detect , escalate, and resolve security incidents.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8tEh-3gkxs,20150728,1077,https://github.com/hakceracademy/seckc-academy-resources/tree/main/transcripts/Security-Operations/v8tEh-3gkxs.txt

In a lot of cases, getting your internet-connected toaster compromised might only lead to burnt toast and minor scaring, but the same cannot be said for some other devices. Since the internet is for porn, it is only natural for devices to be created to support that philosophy. Our research into a couple of these devices, dubbed The Internet of Dongs, surfaced some interesting and scary results.

Sure, there have been some exotic new designs but most are just not fiscally feasible compared to their relatively minor improvements (if any) in security. A feature desired on large scale deployments is called Master Keying, which allows for many unique key/lock combinations while supporting multiple permission levels commonly referred to as ""janitor keys"" or ""security keys"" that can open multiple locks. While these systems are still in use around the globe in medium-to-large scale businesses, schools, and government buildings, they are also susceptible to what some consider to be the original privilege escalation attack.

Google's Project Zero is a one of the most prominent groups in which their security researchers follow a 90 day coordinated disclosure policy. However, there are some within the security research community that are pushing back against the notion of responsible disclosure, arguing that research is being undervalued by the very companies that directly benefit from their hard work. These researchers argue that the security research community not only needs to command a higher profit for their work, but that they need to demand companies take a stronger stance to improve their security posture. Leading the forefront of this controversial movement is a security research firm that is focused on improving security in a particular field: healthcare.

Part of that testing includes testing the inputs of our applications. However, most of the time our inputs are a set of pseudo random inputs. Fuzz testing takes input testing to another level by removing the well-defined input and replacing it with truly random inputs. Targeting an asset with random inputs allow the attacker to find new attack vectors. Creating a bug by finding memory related errors, race conditions or any undefined behavior, gives an attacker the ability to exploit the system in ways you might not have thought of. In this talk, I will give an overview of fuzz testing, how it can be used to find vulnerabilities and demonstrate how it is done.

2020,,Making MITRE ATT&CK Actionable,Josh Rickard,Twitter (@MSAdministrator),Threat Intelligence,"MITRE ATT&CK provides security teams with a framework to assist with detecting attacks and the techniques used by malicious actors. Currently, using MITRE ATT&CK generally entails an intensely manual processes since MITRE ATT&CK is strictly text-based. In order to build detections or create defense strategies using ATT&CK, security practitioners must have deep technical knowledge of attack phases (Tactics) as well as experience (and knowledge) in specific procedures (Techniques) used by attackers. Security teams can use ATT&CK to build defensive objectives (strategies) but lack the ability to make these objectives actionable. During this talk, I will discuss two open-source projects (pyattck & PSAttck) I have released to assist with making MITRE ATT&CK actionable. These open-source tools are focused towards security practitioners and enables them by providing additional information as it relates to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, actors, and tools. By enriching MITRE ATT&CK using multiple open-source projects, security professionals have access to potential commands, detections and queries related to attacker techniques as well as known targets, operations, and additional tools used by actors not included within ATT&CK's dataset. You also have access to additional names and data points which enables offensive teams when selecting tools and C2 infrastructure. Having access to this additional context, security professionals can now search their logs for potential commands related to a specific technique, retrieve potential detections & queries to assist with making MITRE ATT&CK actionable. By providing this additional (actionable) context, security teams can begin using ATT&CK on day one.",,,,

Some employers look favorably on institutional training from a well-known vendor, or well-known conferences. This talk will discuss using side gigs to maximize your ability as an IT Professional to fund your learning and travel and get the government to let you do it in a tax advantaged way! In today's dynamic professional landscape, continuous development is not just a luxury but a necessity for success.

Networking is just as important in our career field as many others. Traveling to conferences, meeting new folks and reconnecting with old acquaintances could lead to the next development for your future.
